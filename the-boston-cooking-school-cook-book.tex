\chapter*{Preface From The Author}


  “But for life the universe were nothing; and all that has life
  requires nourishment.”


With the progress of knowledge the needs of the human body have not been
forgotten. During the last decade much time has been given by scientists
to the study of foods and their dietetic value, and it is a subject
which rightfully should demand much consideration from all. I certainly
feel that the time is not far distant when a knowledge of the principles
of diet will be an essential part of one's education. Then mankind will
eat to live, will be able to do better mental and physical work, and
disease will be less frequent.

At the earnest solicitation of educators, pupils, and friends, I have
been urged to prepare this book, and I trust it may be a help to many
who need its aid. It is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a
compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may awaken an
interest through its condensed scientific knowledge which will lead to
deeper thought and broader study of what to eat.

                                                                F. M. F.


\chapter*{Preface From Tristan}


You had said you wanted a recipe book for Christmas. I thought about looking up recipes online and putting something together, but opted to find something that already existed. I found this book in Project Gutenburg, which is a website dedicated to preserving digital copies of books that have entered the public domain. So since this is in the public domain, I can "legally" print it at Staples.

This book is quite old now, but people online still seem to think that it's a good book with solid recipes and methods. But after scanning through it multiple times there are definitely some parts that are a little \textit{dated}. For example, I changed the chapter title for "Helpful Hints for the Young Housekeeper" to just "Helpful Hints", or changed the spelling of protein from "proteib" with a B to "protein". I'm sure there are many other things like this that I did not change.

I fear there may be a tad bit of sexism in this book, but if you don't look too closely I hope you can still enjoy a recipe or two, and enjoy this as an interesting piece of history.

Love, Tristan.

\chapter{Food}



Food is anything which nourishes the body. From fifteen to twenty
elements enter into the composition of the body, of which the following
thirteen are considered: oxygen, 62 1/2\%; carbon, 21 1/2\%; hydrogen, 10\%;
nitrogen, 3\%; calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium,
magnesium, iron, and fluorine the remaining 3\%.

Food is necessary for growth, repair, and energy; therefore the elements
composing the body must be found in the food. The thirteen elements
named are formed into chemical compounds by the vegetable and animal
kingdoms to support the highest order of being, man. All food must
undergo chemical change after being taken into the body, before it can
be utilized by the body; this is the office of the digestive system.

Food is classified as follows:


\begin{tabular}{clp{3.5in}}
I. & ORGANIC & 1. Protein (nitrogenous or albuminous) \\
 & & 2. Carbohydrates (sugar and starch) \\
 & & 3. Fats and oils \\[0.5em]
II. & INORGANIC & 1. Mineral matter \\
 & & 2. Water \\
\end{tabular}

The chief office of proteins is to build and repair tissues. They
furnish energy, but at greater cost than carbohydrates, fats, and oils.
They contain nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur or
phosphorus, and include all forms of animal foods (excepting fats and
glycogen) and some vegetable foods. Examples: milk, cheese, eggs, meat,
fish, cereals, peas, beans, and lentils. The principal constituent of
protein food is albumen. Albumen as found in food takes different names,
but has the same chemical composition; as, \textit{albumen} in eggs, \textit{fibrin}
in meat, \textit{casein} in milk and cheese, \textit{vegetable casein} or \textit{legumen} in
peas, beans, and lentils; and \textit{gluten} in wheat. To this same class
belongs gelatin.

The chief office of the carbohydrates is to furnish energy and maintain
heat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and include foods
containing starch and sugar. Examples: vegetables, fruits, cereals,
sugars, and gums.

The chief office of fats and oils is to store energy and heat to be used
as needed, and constitute the adipose tissues of the body. Examples:
butter, cream, fat of meat, fish, cereals, nuts, and the berry of the
olive-tree.

The chief office of mineral matter is to furnish the necessary salts
which are found in all animal and vegetable foods. Examples: sodium
chloride (common salt); carbonates, sulphates and phosphates of sodium,
potassium, and magnesium; besides calcium phosphates and iron.

Water constitutes about two-thirds the weight of the body, and is in all
tissues and fluids; therefore its abundant use is necessary. One of the
greatest errors in diet is neglect to take enough water; while it is
found in all animal and vegetable food, the amount is insufficient.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Correct Proportions Of Food}

Age, sex, occupation, climate, and season must determine the diet of a
person in normal condition.

Liquid food (milk or milk in preparation with the various prepared foods
on the market) should constitute the diet of a child for the first
eighteen months. After the teeth appear, by which time ferments have
been developed for the digestion of starchy foods, entire wheat bread,
baked potatoes, cereals, meat broths, and occasionally boiled eggs may
be given. If mothers would use Dr. Johnson's Educators in place of the
various sweet crackers, children would be as well pleased and better
nourished; with a glass of milk they form a supper suited to the needs
of little ones, and experience has shown that children seldom tire of
them. The diet should be gradually increased by the addition of cooked
fruits, vegetables, and simple desserts; the third or fourth year fish
and meat may be introduced, if given sparingly. Always avoid salted
meats, coarse vegetables (beets, carrots, and turnips), cheese, fried
food, pastry, rich desserts, confections, condiments, tea, coffee, and
iced water. For school children the diet should be varied and abundant,
constantly bearing in mind that this is a period of great mental and
physical growth. Where children have broken down, supposedly from
over-work, the cause has often been traced to impoverished diet. It must
not be forgotten that digestive processes go on so rapidly that the
stomach is soon emptied. Thanks to the institutor of the school
luncheon-counter!

The daily average ration of an adult requires:


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item 4 1/2 oz. protein
\item 2 oz. fat
\item 18 oz. starch
\item 5 pints water
\end{itemize}


About one-third of the water is taken in our food, the remainder as a
beverage. To keep in health and do the best mental and physical work,
authorities agree that a mixed diet is suited for temperate climates,
although sound arguments appear from the vegetarian. Women, even though
they do the same amount of work as men, as a rule require less food.
Brain workers should take their protein in a form easily digested. In
consideration of this fact, fish and eggs form desirable substitutes for
meat. The working man needs quantity as well as quality, that the
stomach may have something to act upon. Corned beef, cabbage,
brown-bread, and pastry, will not overtax his digestion. In old age the
digestive organs lessen in activity, and the diet should be almost as
simple as that of a child, increasing the amount of carbohydrates and
decreasing the amount of proteins and fat. Many diseases which occur
after middle life are due to eating and drinking such foods as were
indulged in during vigorous manhood.

\section*{Water (H2o)}

Water is a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid. It is derived from
five sources,--rains, rivers, surface-water or shallow wells, deep wells,
and springs. Water is never found pure in nature; it is nearly pure when
gathered in an open field, after a heavy rainfall, or from springs. For
town and city supply, surface-water is furnished by some adjacent pond
or lake. Samples of such water are carefully and frequently analyzed, to
make sure that it is not polluted with disease germs.

The hardness of water depends upon the amount of salts of lime and
magnesia which it contains. Soft water is free from objectionable salts,
and is preferable for household purposes. Hard water may be softened by
boiling, or by the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda
(NaHCO\textsubscript{3}).

Water freezes at a temperature of 32deg F., boils at 212deg F.; when bubbles
appear on the surface and burst, the boiling-point is reached. In high
altitudes water boils at a lower temperature. From 32deg to 65deg F. water
is termed cold; from 65deg to 92deg F., tepid; 92deg to 100deg F., warm; over
that temperature, hot. Boiled water is freed from all organic
impurities, and salts of lime are precipitated: it does not ferment, and
is a valuable antiseptic. Hot water is more stimulating than cold, and
is of use taken on an empty stomach, while at a temperature of from 60deg
to 95deg F. it is used as an emetic; 90deg F. being the most favorable
temperature.

Distilled water is chemically pure and is always used for medicinal
purposes. It is flat and insipid to the taste, having been deprived of
its atmospheric gases.

There are many charged, carbonated, and mineral spring waters bottled
and put on the market; many of these are used as agreeable table
beverages. Examples: Soda Water, Apollinaris, Poland, Seltzer, and
Vichy. Some contain minerals of medicinal value. Examples: Lithia,
saline, and sulphur waters.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Salts}

Of all salts found in the body, the most abundant and valuable is sodium
chloride (NaCl), common salt; it exists in all tissues, secretions, and
fluids of the body, with the exception of enamel of the teeth. The
amount found in food is not always sufficient; therefore salt is used as
a condiment. It assists digestion, inasmuch as it furnishes chlorine for
hydrochloric acid found in gastric juice.

Common salt is obtained from evaporation of spring and sea-water, also
from mines. Our supply of salt obtained by evaporation comes chiefly
from Michigan and New York; mined salt from Louisiana and Kansas.

Salt is a great preservative; advantage is taken of this in salting meat
and fish.

Other salts--lime, phosphorus, magnesia, potash, sulphur, and iron--are
obtained in sufficient quantity from food we eat and water we drink. In
young children, perfect formation of bones and teeth depends upon
phosphorus and lime taken into the system; these are found in meat and
fish, but abound in cereals.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Starch (C6h10o5)}

Starch is a white, glistening powder; it is largely distributed
throughout the vegetable kingdom, being found most abundantly in cereals
and potatoes. Being a force-producer and heat-giver it forms one of the
most important foods. Alone it cannot sustain life, but must be taken in
combination with foods which build and repair tissues.


\textbf{Test for Starch.} A weak solution of iodine added to cold cooked starch
gives an intense blue color.

Starch is insoluble in cold water, and soluble to but a small extent in
boiling water. Cold water separates starch-grains, boiling water causes
them to swell and burst, thus forming a paste.

Starch subjected to dry heat is changed to \textit{dextrine}
(C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{10}O\textsubscript{5}), British gum. Dextrine subjected to heat plus an acid
or a ferment is changed to \textit{dextrose} (C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{12}O\textsubscript{6}). Dextrose
occurs in ripe fruit, honey, sweet wine, and as a manufactured product.
When grain is allowed to germinate for malting purposes, starch is
changed to dextrine and dextrose. In fermentation, dextrose is changed
to alcohol (C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{5}HO) and carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}). Examples: bread
making, vinegar, and distilled liquors.

Glycogen, animal starch, is found in many animal tissues and in some
fungi. Examples: in liver of meat and oysters.

Raw starch is not digestible; consequently all foods containing starch
should be subjected to boiling water or dry heat, and thoroughly cooked.
Starch is manufactured from wheat, corn, and potatoes. \textbf{Corn-starch} is
manufactured from Indian corn. \textbf{Arrowroot}, the purest form of starch,
is obtained from two or three species of the Maranta plant, which grows
in the West Indies and other tropical countries. Bermuda arrowroot is
most highly esteemed. \textbf{Tapioca} is starch obtained from tuberous roots
of the bitter cassava, native of South America. \textbf{Sago} is starch
obtained from sago palms, native of India.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Sugar (C12h22o11)}

Sugar is a crystalline substance, differing from starch by its sweet
taste and solubility in cold water. As food, its uses are the same as
starch; all starch must be converted into sugar before it can be
assimilated.

The principal kinds of sugar are: cane sugar or \textit{sucrose}, grape sugar
or \textit{glucose} (C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{12}O\textsubscript{6}), milk sugar or \textit{lactose}
(C\textsubscript{12}H\textsubscript{22}O\textsubscript{11}), and fruit sugar or \textit{levulose} (C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{12}O\textsubscript{6}).

\textbf{Cane sugar} is obtained from sugar cane, beets, and the palm and
sugar-maple trees. Sugar cane is a grass supposed to be native to
Southern Asia, but now grown throughout the tropics, a large amount
coming from Cuba and Louisiana; it is the commonest of all, and in all
cases the manufacture is essentially the same. The products of
manufacture are: molasses, syrup, brown sugar, loaf, cut, granulated,
powdered, and confectioners' sugar. Brown sugar is cheapest, but is not
so pure or sweet as white grades; powdered and confectioners' sugars are
fine grades, pulverized, and, although seeming less sweet to the taste,
are equally pure. Confectioners' sugar when applied to the tongue will
dissolve at once; powdered sugar is a little granular.

Cane sugar when added to fruits, and allowed to cook for some time,
changes to grape sugar, losing one-third of its sweetness; therefore the
reason for adding it when fruit is nearly cooked. Cane sugar is of great
preservative value, hence its use in preserving fruits and milk; also,
for the preparation of syrups.

Three changes take place in the cooking of sugar: first, barley sugar;
second, caramel; third, carbon.

\textbf{Grape sugar} is found in honey and all sweet fruits. It appears on the
outside of dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, etc., and is only
two-thirds as sweet as cane sugar. As a manufactured product it is
obtained from the starch of corn.

\textbf{Milk sugar} is obtained from the milk of mammalia, but unlike cane
sugar does not ferment.

\textbf{Fruit sugar} is obtained from sweet fruits, and is sold as \textit{diabetin},
is sweeter than cane sugar, and is principally used by diabetic
patients.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Gum, Pectose, And Cellulose}

These compounds found in food are closely allied to the carbohydrates,
but are neither starchy, saccharine, nor oily. Gum exists in the juices
of almost all plants, coming from the stems, branches, and fruits.
Examples: gum arabic, gum tragacanth, and mucilage. Pectose exists in
the fleshy pulp of unripe fruit; during the process of ripening it
changes to pectin; by cooking, pectin is changed to pectosic acid, and
by longer cooking to pectic acid. Pectosic acid is jelly-like when cold;
pectic acid is jelly-like when hot or cold. Cellulose constitutes the
cell-walls of vegetable life; in very young vegetables it is possible
that it can be acted upon by the digestive ferments; in older vegetables
it becomes woody and completely indigestible.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Fats And Oils}

Fats and oils are found in both the animal and vegetable kingdom. Fats
are solid; oils are liquid; they may be converted into a liquid state by
application of heat; they contain three substances,--\textit{stearin} (solid),
\textit{olein} (liquid), \textit{palmitin} (semi-solid). Suet is an example where
stearin is found in excess; lard, where olein is in excess; and butter,
where palmitin is in excess. Margarin is a mixture of stearin and
palmitin. The fatty acids are formed of stearin, olein, and palmitin,
with glycerine as the base. Examples: stearic, palmitic, and oleic acid.
Butyric acid is acid found in butter. These are not sour to the taste,
but are called acids on account of their chemical composition.

Among animal fats cream and butter are of first importance as foods, on
account of their easy assimilation. Other examples are: the fat of
meats, bone-marrow, suet (the best found around the loin and kidneys of
the beef creature), lard, cottolene, coto suet, cocoanut butter,
butterine, and oleomargarine. The principal animal oils are cod liver
oil and oil found in the yolk of egg; principal vegetable oils are
olive, cottonseed, poppy, and cocoanut oils, and oils obtained from
various nuts.

Oils are divided into two classes, \textit{essential} and \textit{fixed}. Essential
oils are volatile and soluble in alcohol. Examples: clove, rose, nutmeg,
and violet. Fixed oils are non-volatile and soluble in ether, oil, or
turpentine. Examples: oil of nuts, corn meal, and mustard.

Fats may be heated to a high temperature, as considered in cookery they
have no boiling-point. When appearing to boil, it is evident water has
been added, and the temperature lowered to that of boiling water, 212deg
F.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent
The value of milk as a food is obvious from the fact that it constitutes
the natural food of all young mammalia during the period of their most
rapid growth. There is some danger, however, of overestimating its value
in the dietary of adults, as solid food is essential, and liquid taken
should act as a stimulant and a solvent rather than as a nutrient. One
obtains the greatest benefit from milk when taken alone at regular
intervals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped, rather than
drunk. Hot milk is often given to produce sleep.

When milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the globules of fat,
which have been held in suspension throughout the liquid, rise to the
top in the form of \textit{cream}; this is due to their lower specific gravity.

The difference in quality of milk depends chiefly on the quantity of fat
therein: casein, lactose, and mineral matter being nearly constant,
water varying but little unless milk is adulterated.

\textbf{Why Milk Sours.} A germ found floating in the air attacks a portion of
the lactose in the milk, converting it into lactic acid; this, in turn,
acts upon the casein (protein) and precipitates it, producing what is
known as \textit{curd} and \textit{whey}. Whey contains water, salts, and some sugar.

Milk is preserved by sterilization, pasteurization, and evaporation.
\textit{Fresh condensed milk}, a form of evaporized milk, is sold in bulk, and
is preferred by many to serve with coffee. Various brands of condensed
milk and cream are on the market in tin cans, hermetically sealed.
Examples: Nestle's Swiss Condensed Milk, Eagle Condensed Milk, Daisy
Condensed Milk, Highland Evaporated Cream, Borden's Peerless Evaporated
Cream. \textit{Malted milk}--evaporized milk in combination with extracts of
malted barley and wheat--is used to a considerable extent; it is sold in
the form of powder.

Thin, or strawberry, and thick cream may be obtained from almost all
creameries. Devonshire, or clotted cream, is cream which has been
removed from milk allowed to heat slowly to a temperature of about 150deg
F.

In feeding infants with milk, sterilization or pasteurization is
sometimes recommended to avoid danger of infectious germs. By this
process milk can be kept for many days, and transported if necessary. To
prevent acidity of the stomach, add from one to two teaspoonfuls of lime
water to each half-pint of milk. Lime water may be bought at any
druggist's, or easily prepared at home.


\textbf{Lime Water.} Pour two quarts boiling water over an inch cube unslacked
lime; stir thoroughly and stand over night; in the morning pour off the
liquid that is clear, and bottle for use. Keep in a cool place.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent
Butter of commerce is made from cream of cow's milk. The quality depends
upon the breed of cow, manner of, and care in, feeding. Milk from Jersey
and Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of butter.

Butter should be kept in a cool place and well covered, otherwise it is
liable to become rancid; this is due to the albuminous constituents of
the milk, acting as a ferment, setting free the fatty acids.
First-quality butter should be used; this does not include pat butter or
fancy grades. Poor butter has not been as thoroughly worked during
manufacture, consequently more casein remains; therefore it is more apt
to become rancid. Fresh butter spoils quickly; salt acts as a
preservative. Butter which has become rancid by too long keeping may be
greatly improved by melting, heating, and quickly chilling with
ice-water. The butter will rise to the top, and may be easily removed.

Where butter cannot be afforded, there are several products on the
market which have the same chemical composition as butter, and are
equally wholesome. Examples: butterine and oleomargarine.

Buttermilk is liquid remaining after butter “has come.” When taken
fresh, it makes a wholesome beverage.

\end{tabular}

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent
Cheese is the solid part of sweet milk obtained by heating milk and
coagulating it by means of rennet or an acid. Rennet is an infusion made
from prepared inner membrane of the fourth stomach of the calf. The curd
is salted and subjected to pressure. Cheese is made from skim milk, milk
plus cream, or cream. Cheese is kept for a longer or shorter time,
according to the kind, that fermentation or decomposition may take
place. This is called ripening. Some cream cheeses are not allowed to
ripen. Milk from Jersey and Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of
cheese.

Cheese is very valuable food; being rich in protein, it may be used as a
substitute for meat. A pound of cheese is equal in protein to two pounds
of beef. Cheese in the raw state is difficult of digestion. This is
somewhat overcome by cooking and adding a small amount of bicarbonate of
soda. A small piece of rich cheese is often eaten to assist digestion.

The various brands of cheese take their names from the places where
made. Many foreign ones are now well imitated in this country. The
favorite kinds of skim-milk cheese are: Edam, Gruyère, and Parmesan.
Parmesan is very hard and used principally for grating. The holes in
Gruyère are due to aeration.

The favorite kinds of milk cheese are: Gloucester, Cheshire, Cheddar,
and Gorgonzola; Milk and Cream cheese: Stilton and Double Gloucester;
Cream cheese: Brie, Neufchâtel, and Camembert.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Fruits}

The varieties of fruits consumed are numerous, and their uses important.
They are chiefly valuable for their sugar, acids, and salts, and are
cooling, refreshing, and stimulating. They act as a tonic, and assist in
purifying the blood. Many contain a jelly-like substance, called pectin,
and several contain starch, which during the ripening process is
converted into glucose. Bananas, dates, figs, prunes, and grapes, owing
to their large amount of sugar, are the most nutritious. Melons,
oranges, lemons, and grapes contain the largest amount of water. Apples,
lemons, and oranges are valuable for their potash salts, and oranges and
lemons especially valuable for their citric acid. It is of importance to
those who are obliged to exclude much sugar from their dietary, to know
that plums, peaches, apricots, and raspberries have less sugar than
other fruits; apples, sweet cherries, grapes, and pears contain the
largest amount. Apples are obtainable nearly all the year, and on
account of their variety, cheapness, and abundance, are termed queen of
fruits.

Thoroughly ripe fruits should be freely indulged in, and to many are
more acceptable than desserts prepared in the kitchen. If possible,
fruits should always appear on the breakfast-table. In cases where
uncooked fruit cannot be freely eaten, many kinds may be cooked and
prove valuable. Never eat unripe fruit, or that which is beginning to
decay. Fruits should be wiped or rinsed before serving.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Vegetable Acids, And Where Found}

The principal vegetable acids are:

\textbf{I.} Acetic (HC\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{3}O\textsubscript{2}), found in wine and vinegar.

\textbf{II.} Tartaric (H\textsubscript{2}C\textsubscript{4}H\textsubscript{4}O\textsubscript{6}), found in grapes, pineapples, and
tamarinds.

\textbf{III.} Malic, much like tartaric, found in apples, pears, peaches,
apricots, gooseberries, and currants.

\textbf{IV.} Citric (H\textsubscript{3}C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{5}O\textsubscript{7}), found in lemons, oranges, limes, and
citron.

\textbf{V.} Oxalic (H\textsubscript{2}C\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{4}), found in rhubarb and sorrel.

To these may be added tannic acid, obtained from gall nuts. Some fruits
contain two or more acids. Malic and citric are found in strawberries,
raspberries, gooseberries, and cherries; malic, citric, and oxalic in
cranberries.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Condiments}

Condiments are not classed among foods, but are known as food adjuncts.
They are used to stimulate the appetite by adding flavor to food. Among
the most important are salt, spices, and various flavorings. Salt,
according to some authorities, is called a food, being necessary to
life.

\textbf{Black pepper} is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns are the dried berries
of \textit{Piper nigrum}, grown in the West Indies, Sumatra, and other eastern
countries.

\textbf{White pepper} is made from the same berry, the outer husk being removed
before grinding. It is less irritating than black pepper to the coating
of the stomach.

\textbf{Cayenne pepper} is the powdered pod of \textit{Capsicum} grown on the eastern
coast of Africa and in Zanzibar.

\textbf{Mustard} is the ground seed of two species of the Brassica. \_Brassica
alba\textit{ yields white mustard seeds; }Brassica nigra\_, black mustard seeds.
Both species are grown in Europe and America.

\textbf{Ginger} is the pulverized dried root of \textit{Zanzibar officinale}, grown in
Jamaica, China, and India. Commercially speaking, there are three
grades,--Jamaica, best and strongest; Cochin, and African.

\textbf{Cinnamon} is the ground inner bark of \textit{Cinnamomum zeylanicum},
principally grown in Ceylon. The cinnamon of commerce (cassia) is the
powdered bark of different species of the same shrub, which is
principally grown in China, and called Chinese cinnamon. It is cheaper
than true cinnamon.

\textbf{Clove} is the ground flower buds of \textit{Caryophyllus aromaticus}, native
to the Moluccas or Spice Islands, but now grown principally in Zanzibar,
Pemba, and the West Indies.

\textbf{Pimento} (commonly called allspice) is the ground fruit of \_Eugenia
pimenta\_, grown in Jamaica and the West Indies.

\textbf{Nutmeg} is the kernel of the fruit of the \textit{Myristica fragans}, grown in
Banda Islands.

\textbf{Mace.} The fibrous network which envelops the nutmeg seed constitutes
the mace of commerce.

\textbf{Vinegar} is made from apple cider, malt, and wine, and is the product
of fermentation. It is a great preservative; hence its use in the making
of pickles, sauces, and other condiments. The amount of acetic acid in
vinegar varies from two to seven per cent.

\textbf{Capers} are flower buds of \textit{Capparis spinosa}, grown in countries
bordering the Mediterranean. They are preserved in vinegar, and bottled
for importation.

\textbf{Horseradish} is the root of \textit{Cochliaria armoracia},--a plant native to
Europe, but now grown in our own country. It is generally grated, mixed
with vinegar, and bottled.

\section*{Flavoring Extracts}

Many flavoring extracts are on the market. Examples: almond, vanilla,
lemon, orange, peach, and rose. These are made from the flower, fruit,
or seed from which they are named. Strawberry, pineapple, and banana
extracts are manufactured from chemicals.








\chapter{Cookery}



Cookery is the art of preparing food for the nourishment of the body.

Prehistoric man may have lived on uncooked foods, but there are no
savage races to-day who do not practise cookery in some way, however
crude. Progress in civilization has been accompanied by progress in
cookery.

Much time has been given in the last few years to the study of foods,
their necessary proportions, and manner of cooking them. Educators have
been shown by scientists that this knowledge should be disseminated; as
a result, “Cookery” is found in the curriculum of public schools of many
of our towns and cities.

Food is cooked to develop new flavors, to make it more palatable and
digestible, and to destroy micro-organisms. For cooking there are three
essentials (besides the material to be cooked),--heat, air, and moisture.

\textbf{Heat} is molecular motion, and is produced by combustion. Heat used for
cookery is obtained by the combustion of inflammable substances--wood,
coal, charcoal, coke, gas, gasoline, kerosene, and alcohol--called fuels.
Heat for cookery is applied by radiation, conduction, and convection.

\textbf{Air} is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and surrounds
everything. Combustion cannot take place without it, the oxygen of the
air being the only supporter of combustion.

\textbf{Moisture}, in the form of water, either found in the food or added to
it.

The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and bursts
starch-grains; hardens albumen in eggs, fish, and meat; softens fibrous
portions of meat, and cellulose of vegetables.

Among fuels, kerosene oil is the cheapest; gas gives the greatest amount
of heat in the shortest time. \textit{Soft wood}, like pine, on account of its
coarse fibre, burns quickly; therefore makes the best kindling. \_Hard
wood\_, like oak and ash, having the fibres closely packed, burns slowly,
and is used in addition to pine wood for kindling coal. Where only wood
is used as a fuel, it is principally hard wood.

\textit{Charcoal} for fuel is produced by the smothered combustion of wood. It
gives an intense, even heat, therefore makes a good broiling fire. Its
use for kindling is not infrequent.

There are two kinds of coal: \textit{Anthracite}, or \textit{hard coal}. Examples:
Hard and free-burning White Ash, Shamokin, and Franklin. Nut is any kind
of hard coal obtained from screenings. \textit{Bituminous}, or \textit{soft coal}.
Example: cannel coal.

\textit{Coke} is the solid product of carbonized coal, and bears the same
relation to coal that charcoal bears to wood.

\textit{Alcohol} is employed as fuel when the chafing-dish is used.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Fire}

Fire for cookery is confined in a stove or range, so that heat may be
utilized and regulated. Flame-heat is obtained from kerosene, gas, or
alcohol, as used in oil-stoves, gas-stoves or gas-ranges, and
chafing-dishes.

\textbf{A cooking-stove} is a large iron box set on legs. It has a fire-box in
the front, the sides of which are lined with fireproof material similar
to that of which bricks are made. The bottom is furnished with a movable
iron grate. Underneath the fire-box is a space which extends from the
grate to a pan for receiving ashes. At the back of fire-box is a
compartment called the oven, accessible on each side of the stove by a
door. Between the oven and the top of the stove is a space for the
circulation of air.

Stoves are connected with chimney-flues by means of a stovepipe, and
have dampers to regulate the supply of air and heat, and as an outlet
for smoke and gases.

The damper below the fire-box is known as the \textit{front damper}, by means
of which the air supply is regulated, thus regulating the heat.

The oven is heated by a circulation of hot air. This is accomplished by
closing the \textit{oven-damper}, which is situated near the oven. When this
damper is left open, the hot air rushes up the chimney. The damper near
the chimney is known as the \textit{chimney-damper}. When open it gives a free
outlet for the escape of smoke and gas. When partially closed, as is
usually the case in most ranges, except when the fire is started, it
serves as a saver of heat. There is also a \textit{check}, which, when open,
cools the fire and saves heat, but should always be closed except when
used for this purpose.

Stoves are but seldom used, portable ranges having taken their places.

\textbf{A portable range} is a cooking-stove with one oven door; it often has
an under oven, of use for warming dishes and keeping food hot.

\textbf{A set range} is built in a fireplace. It usually has two ovens, one on
each side of the fire-box, or two above it at the back. Set ranges, as
they consume so large an amount of fuel, are being replaced by portable
ones.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{How To Build A Fire}

Before starting to build a fire, free the grate from ashes. To do this,
put on covers, close front and back dampers, and open oven-damper; turn
grate, and ashes will fall into the ash receiver. If these rules are not
followed, ashes will fly over the room. Turn grate back into place,
remove the covers over fire-box, and cover grate with pieces of paper
(twisted in centre and left loose at the ends). Cover paper with small
sticks, or pieces of pine wood, being sure that the wood reaches the
ends of fire-box, and so arranged that it will admit air. Over pine wood
arrange hard wood; then sprinkle with two shovelfuls of coal. Put on
covers, open closed dampers, strike a match,--sufficient friction is
formed to burn the phosphorus, this in turn lights the sulphur, and the
sulphur the wood,--then apply the lighted match under the grate, and you
have a fire.

Now blacken the stove. Begin at front of range, and work towards the
back; as the iron heats, a good polish may be obtained. When the wood is
thoroughly kindled, add more coal. A blue flame will soon appear, which
is the gas (CO) in the coal burning to carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), when the
blue flame changes to a white flame; then the oven-damper should be
closed. In a few moments the front damper may be nearly closed, leaving
space to admit sufficient oxygen to feed the fire. It is sometimes
forgotten that oxygen is necessary to keep a fire burning. As soon as
the coal is well ignited, half close the chimney-damper, unless the
draft be very poor.

Never allow the fire-box to be more than three-fourths filled. When
full, the draft is checked, a larger amount of fuel is consumed, and
much heat is lost. This is a point that should be impressed on the mind
of the cook.

Ashes must be removed and sifted daily; pick over and save good
coals,--which are known as cinders,--throwing out useless pieces, known as
clinkers.

If a fire is used constantly during the day, replenish coal frequently,
but in small quantities. If for any length of time the fire is not
needed, open check, the dampers being closed; when again wanted for use,
close check, open front damper, and with a poker rake out ashes from
under fire, and wait for fire to burn brightly before adding new coal.

Coal when red hot has parted with most of its heat. Some refuse to
believe this, and insist upon keeping dampers open until most of the
heat has escaped into the chimney.

To keep a fire over night, remove the ashes from under the fire, put on
enough coal to fill the box, close the dampers, and lift the back covers
enough to admit air. This is better than lifting the covers over the
fire-box and prevents poisonous gases entering the room.

\section*{Ways Of Cooking}

The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, stewing, roasting,
baking, frying, sautéing, braising, and fricasseeing.

\textbf{Boiling} is cooking in boiling water. Solid food so cooked is called
boiled food, though literally this expression is incorrect. Examples:
boiled eggs, potatoes, mutton, etc.

Water boils at 212deg F. (sea level), and simmers at 185deg F. Slowly
boiling water has the same temperature as rapidly boiling water,
consequently is able to do the same work,--a fact often forgotten by the
cook, who is too apt “to wood” the fire that water may boil vigorously.

Watery vapor and steam pass off from boiling water. Steam is invisible;
watery vapor is visible, and is often miscalled steam. Cooking utensils
commonly used admit the escape of watery vapor and steam; thereby much
heat is lost if food is cooked in rapidly boiling water.

Water is boiled for two purposes: first, cooking of itself to destroy
organic impurities; second, for cooking foods. Boiling water toughens
and hardens albumen in eggs; toughens fibrin and dissolves tissues in
meat; bursts starch-grains and softens cellulose in cereals and
vegetables. Milk should never be allowed to boil. At boiling temperature
(214deg F.) the casein is slightly hardened, and the fat is rendered more
difficult of digestion. Milk heated over boiling water, as in a double
boiler, is called \textit{scalded milk}, and reaches a temperature of 196deg F.
When foods are cooked over hot water the process is called steaming.

\textbf{Stewing} is cooking in a small amount of hot water for a long time at
low temperature; it is the most economical way of cooking meats, as all
nutriment is retained, and the ordinary way of cooking cheaper cuts.
Thus fibre and connective tissues are softened, and the whole is made
tender and palatable.

\textbf{Broiling} is cooking over or in front of a clear fire. The food to be
cooked is usually placed in a greased broiler or on a gridiron held near
the coals, turned often at first to sear the outside,--thus preventing
escape of inner juices,--afterwards turned occasionally. Tender meats and
fish may be cooked in this way. The flavor obtained by broiling is
particularly fine; there is, however, a greater loss of weight in this
than in any other way of cooking, as the food thus cooked is exposed to
free circulation of air. When coal is not used, or a fire is not in
condition for broiling, a plan for \textit{pan broiling} has been adopted. This
is done by placing food to be cooked in a hissing hot frying-pan,
turning often as in broiling.

\textbf{Roasting} is cooking before a clear fire, with a reflector to
concentrate the heat. Heat is applied in the same way as for broiling,
the difference being that the meat for roasting is placed on a spit and
allowed to revolve, thicker pieces alway being employed. Tin-kitchens
are now but seldom used. Meats cooked in a range oven, though really
baked, are said to be roasted. Meats so cooked are pleasing to the sight
and agreeable to the palate, although, according to Edward Atkinson, not
so easily digested as when cooked at a lower temperature in the Aladdin
oven.

\textbf{Baking} is cooking in a range oven.

\textbf{Frying} is cooking by means of immersion in deep fat raised to a
temperature of 350deg to 400deg F. For frying purposes olive oil, lard, beef
drippings, cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut butter are used. A
combination of two-thirds lard and one-third beef suet (tried out and
clarified) is better than lard alone. Cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut
butter are economical, inasmuch as they may be heated to a high
temperature without discoloring, therefore may be used for a larger
number of fryings. Cod fat obtained from beef is often used by \textit{chefs}
for frying.

Great care should be taken in frying that fat is of the right
temperature; otherwise food so cooked will absorb fat.

Nearly all foods which do not contain eggs are dipped in flour or
crumbs, egg, and crumbs, before frying. The intense heat of fat hardens
the albumen, thus forming a coating which prevents food from “soaking
fat.”

When meat or fish is to be fried, it should be kept in a warm room for
some time previous to cooking, and wiped as dry as possible. If cold, it
decreases the temperature of the fat to such extent that a coating is
not formed quickly enough to prevent fat from penetrating the food. The
ebullition of fat is due to water found in food to be cooked.

Great care must be taken that too much is not put into the fat at one
time, not only because it lowers the temperature of the fat, but because
it causes it to bubble and go over the sides of the kettle. It is not
fat that boils, but water which fat has received from food.

All fried food on removal from fat should be drained on brown paper.

\textbf{Rules for Testing Fat for Frying.} 1. When the fat begins to smoke,
drop in an inch cube of bread from soft part of loaf, and if in forty
seconds it is golden brown, the fat is then of right temperature for
frying any cooked mixture.

2. Use same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one minute for bread to
brown.

Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat; new fat should be used
for batter and dough mixtures, potatoes, and fishballs; after these,
fish, meat, and croquettes. Fat should be frequently clarified.

\textbf{To Clarify Fat.} Melt fat, add raw potato cut in quarter-inch slices,
and allow fat to heat gradually; when fat ceases to bubble and potatoes
are well browned, strain through double cheese-cloth, placed over wire
strainer, into a pan. The potato absorbs any odors or gases, and
collects to itself some of the sediment, remainder settling to bottom of
kettle.

When small amount of fat is to be clarified, add to cold fat boiling
water, stir vigorously, and set aside to cool; the fat will form a cake
on top, which may be easily removed; on bottom of the cake will be found
sediment, which may be readily scraped off with a knife.

Remnants of fat, either cooked or uncooked, should be saved and tried
out, and when necessary clarified.

Fat from beef, poultry, chicken, and pork, may be used for shortening or
frying purposes; fat from mutton and smoked meats may be used for making
hard and soft soap; fat removed from soup stock, the water in which
corned beef has been cooked, and drippings from roast beef, may be tried
out, clarified, and used for shortening or frying purposes.

\textbf{To Try out Fat.} Cut in small pieces and melt in top of a double
boiler; in this way it will require less watching than if placed in
kettle on the back of range. Leaf lard is tried out in the same way; in
cutting the leaf, remove membrane. After straining lard, that which
remains may be salted, pressed, and eaten as a relish, and is called
scraps.

\textbf{Sautéing} is frying in a small quantity of fat. Food so cooked is much
more difficult of digestion than when fried in deep fat; it is
impossible to cook in this way without the food absorbing fat. A
frying-pan or griddle is used; the food is cooked on one side, then
turned, and cooked on the other.

\textbf{Braising} is stewing and baking (meat). Meat to be braised is
frequently first sautéd to prevent escape of much juice in the gravy.
The meat is placed in a pan with a small quantity of stock or water,
vegetables (carrot, turnip, celery, and onion) cut in pieces, salt,
pepper, and sweet herbs. The pan should have a tight-fitting cover. Meat
so prepared should be cooked in an oven at low uniform temperature for a
long time. This is an economical way of cooking, and the only way
besides stewing or boiling of making a large piece of tough meat
palatable and digestible.

\textbf{Fricasseeing} is sautéing and serving with a sauce. Tender meat is
fricasseed without previous cooking; less tender meat requires cooking
in hot water before fricasseeing. Although veal is obtained from a young
creature, it requires long cooking; it is usually sautéd, and then
cooked in a sauce at low temperature for a long time.

\section*{Various Ways Of Preparing Food For Cooking}

\textbf{Egging and Crumbing.} Use for crumbing dried bread crumbs which have
been rolled and sifted, or soft stale bread broken in pieces and forced
through a colander. An ingenious machine on the market, “The Bread
Crumber,” does this work. Egg used for crumbing should be broken into a
shallow plate and beaten with a silver fork to blend yolk and white;
dilute each egg with two tablespoons water. The crumbs should be taken
on a board; food to be fried should be first rolled in crumbs (care
being taken that all parts are covered with crumbs), then dipped in egg
mixture (equal care being taken to cover all parts), then rolled in
crumbs again; after the last crumbing remove food to a place on the
board where there are no crumbs, and shake off some of the outer ones
which make coating too thick. A broad-bladed knife with short handle--the
Teller knife--is the most convenient utensil for lifting food to be
crumbed from egg mixture. Small scallops, oysters, and crabs are more
easily crumbed by putting crumbs and fish in paper and shaking paper
until the fish is covered with crumbs. The object of first crumbing is
to dry the surface that egg may cling to it; and where a thin coating is
desired flour is often used in place of crumbs.

\textbf{Larding} is introducing small pieces of fat salt pork or bacon through
the surface of uncooked meat. The flavor of lean and dry meat is much
improved by larding; tenderloin of beef (fillet), grouse, partridge,
pigeon, and liver are often prepared in this way. Pig pork being firm,
is best for larding. Pork should be kept in a cold place that it may be
well chilled. Remove rind and use the part of pork which lies between
rind and vein. With sharp knife (which is sure to make a clean cut)
remove slices a little less than one-fourth inch thick; cut the slices
into strips a little less than one-fourth inch wide; these strips should
be two and one-fourth inches long, and are called \textit{lardoons}. Lardoons
for small birds--quail, for example--should be cut smaller and not quite
so long. To lard, insert one end of lardoon into larding-needle, hold
needle firmly, and with pointed end take up a stitch one-third inch deep
and three-fourths inch wide; draw needle through, care being taken that
lardoon is left in meat and its ends project to equal lengths. Arrange
lardoons in parallel rows, one inch apart, stitches in the alternate
rows being directly underneath each other. Lard the upper surface of
cuts of meat with the grain, never across it. In birds, insert lardoons
at right angles to breastbone on either side. When large lardoons are
forced through meat from surface to surface, the process is called
daubing. Example: Beef à la mode. Thin slices of fat salt pork placed
over meat may be substituted for larding, but flavor is not the same as
when pork is drawn through flesh, and the dish is far less sightly.

\textbf{Boning} is removing bones from meat or fish, leaving the flesh nearly
in its original shape. For boning, a small sharp knife with pointed
blade is essential. Legs of mutton and veal and loins of beef may be
ordered boned at market, no extra charge being made.

Whoever wishes to learn how to bone should first be taught boning of a
small bird; when this is accomplished, larger birds, chickens, and
turkeys may easily be done, the processes varying but little. In large
birds tendons are drawn from legs, and the wings are left on and boned.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{How to Bone a Bird}

In buying birds for boning, select those which have been fresh killed,
dry picked, and not drawn. Singe, remove pinfeathers, head, and feet,
and cut off wings close to body. Lay bird on a board, breast down.

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the skin the entire
length of body. Scrape the flesh from backbone until end of one
shoulder-blade is found; scrape flesh from shoulder-blade and continue
around wing joint, cutting through tendinous portions which are
encountered; then bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone the entire
length of body, working across the ribs. Free wishbone and collar-bones,
at same time removing crop and windpipe; continue down breastbone,
particular care being taken not to break the skin as it lies very near
bone, or to cut the delicate membranes which enclose entrails. Scrape
flesh from second joints and drumsticks, laying it back and drawing off
as a glove may be drawn from the hand. Withdraw carcass and put flesh
back in its original shape. In large birds where wings are boned, scrape
flesh to middle joint, where bone should be broken, leaving bone at tip
end to assist in preserving shape.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{How to Measure}

Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure the best
results. Good judgment, with experience, has taught some to measure by
sight; but the majority need definite guides.

Tin, granite-ware, and glass measuring cups, divided in quarters or
thirds, holding one half-pint, and tea and table spoons of regulation
sizes,--which may be bought at any store where kitchen furnishings are
sold,--and a case knife, are essentials for correct measurement.
Mixing-spoons, which are little larger than tablespoons, should not be
confounded with the latter.

\textbf{Measuring Ingredients.} Flour, meal, powdered and confectioners' sugar,
and soda should be sifted before measuring. Mustard and baking-powder,
from standing in boxes, settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten;
salt frequently lumps, and these lumps should be broken. A \textit{cupful} is
measured level. To measure a cupful, put in the ingredient by spoonfuls
or from a scoop, round slightly, and level with a case knife, care being
taken not to shake the cup. \_A tablespoonful is measured level. A
teaspoonful is measured level.\_

To measure tea or table spoonfuls, dip the spoon in the ingredient,
fill, lift, and level with a knife, the sharp edge of knife being toward
tip of spoon. Divide with knife lengthwise of spoon, for a
half-spoonful; divide halves crosswise for quarters, and quarters
crosswise for eighths. Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is
considered a few grains.

\textbf{Measuring Liquids.} A cupful of liquid is all the cup will hold.

A tea or table spoonful is all the spoon will hold.

\textbf{Measuring Butter, Lard, etc.} To measure butter, lard, and other solid
fats, pack solidly into cup or spoon, and level with a knife.

When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for in the same
recipe, measure in the order given, thereby using but one cup.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{How to Combine Ingredients}

Next to measuring comes care in combining,--a fact not always recognized
by the inexperienced. Three ways are considered,--stirring, beating, and
cutting and folding.

\textbf{To stir}, mix by using circular motion, widening the circles until all
is blended. Stirring is the motion ordinarily employed in all cookery,
alone or in combination with beating.

\textbf{To beat}, turn ingredient or ingredients over and over, continually
bringing the under part to the surface, thus allowing the utensil used
for beating to be constantly brought in contact with bottom of the dish
and throughout the mixture.

\textbf{To cut and fold}, introduce one ingredient into another ingredient or
mixture by two motions: with a spoon, a repeated vertical downward
motion, known as cutting; and a turning over and over of mixture,
allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact with bottom of dish,
is called folding. These repeated motions are alternated until thorough
blending is accomplished.

\textbf{By stirring}, ingredients are mixed; \textit{by beating}, a large amount of
air is enclosed; \textit{by cutting and folding}, air already introduced is
prevented from escaping.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Ways of Preserving}


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item By Freezing: Foods which spoil readily are frozen for transportation, and must be kept packed in ice until used. Examples: Fish and poultry.
\item By Refrigeration: Foods so preserved are kept in cold storage. The cooling is accomplished by means of ice, or by a machine where compressed gas is cooled and then permitted to expand. Examples: meat, milk, butter, eggs, etc.
\item By Canning: Which is preserving in air-tight glass jars, or tin cans hermetically sealed. When fruit is canned, sugar is usually added.
\item By Sugar: Examples: fruit juices and condensed milk.
\item By Exclusion of Air: Foods are preserved by exclusion of air in other ways than canning. Examples: grapes in bran, eggs in lime water, etc.
\item By Drying: Drying consists in evaporation of nearly all moisture, and is generally combined with salting, except in vegetables and fruits.
\item By Evaporation: There are examples where considerable moistureremains, though much is driven off. Example: beef extract.
\item By Salting: There are two kinds of salting,--dry, and corning or salting in brine. Examples: salt codfish, beef, pork, tripe, etc.
\item By Smoking: Some foods, after being salted, are hung in a closed room for several hours, where hickory wood is allowed to smother. Examples: ham, beef, and fish.
\item By Pickling: Vinegar, to which salt is added, and sometimes sugar and spices, is scalded; and cucumbers, onions, and various kinds of fruit are allowed to remain in it.
\item By Oil: Examples: sardines, anchovies, etc.
\item By Antiseptics: The least wholesome way is by the use of antiseptics. Borax and salicylic acid, when employed, should be used sparingly.

\chapter{Beverages}



A beverage is any drink. Water is the beverage provided for man by
Nature. Water is an essential to life. All beverages contain a large
percentage of water, therefore their uses should be considered:

   I. To quench thirst.

  II. To introduce water into the circulatory system.

 III. To regulate body temperature.

  IV. To assist in carrying off waste.

   V. To nourish.

  VI. To stimulate the nervous system and various organs.

 VII. For medicinal purposes.

Freshly boiled water should be used for making hot beverages; freshly
drawn water for making cold beverages.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Tea}

Tea is used by more than one-half the human race; and, although the
United States is not a tea-drinking country, one and one-half pounds are
consumed per capita per annum.

All tea is grown from one species of shrub, \textit{Thea}, the leaves of which
constitute the tea of commerce. Climate, elevation, soil, cultivation,
and care in picking and curing all go to make up the differences.
First-quality tea is made from young, whole leaves. Two kinds of tea are
considered:

\textit{Black tea}, made from leaves which have been allowed to ferment before
curing.

\textit{Green tea}, made from unfermented leaves artificially colored.

The best black tea comes from India and Ceylon. Some familiar brands are
Oolong, Formosa, English Breakfast, Orange Pekoe, and Flowery Pekoe. The
last two named, often employed at the “five o'clock tea,” command high
prices; they are made from the youngest leaves. Orange Pekoe is scented
with orange leaves. The best green tea comes from Japan. Some familiar
brands are Hyson, Japan, and Gunpowder.

From analysis, it has been found that tea is rich in protein, but taken
as an infusion acts as a stimulant rather than as a nutrient. The
nutriment is gained from sugar and milk served with it. The stimulating
property of tea is due to the alkaloid, \textit{theine}, together with an
essential oil; it contains an astringent, tannin. Black tea contains
less theine, essential oil, and tannin than green tea. The tannic acid,
developed from the tannin by infusion, injures the coating of the
stomach.

Although tea is not a substitute for food, it appears so for a
considerable period of time, as its stimulating effect is immediate. It
is certain that less food is required where much tea is taken, for by
its use there is less wear of the tissues, consequently need of repair.
When taken to excess, it so acts on the nervous system as to produce
sleeplessness or insomnia, and finally makes a complete wreck of its
victim. Taken in moderation, it acts as a mild stimulant, and ingests a
considerable amount of water into the system; it heats the body in
winter, and cools the body in summer. Children should never be allowed
to drink tea, and it had better be avoided by the young, while it may be
indulged in by the aged, as it proves a valuable stimulant as the
functional activities of the stomach become weakened.

Freshly boiled water should be used for making tea. Boiled, because
below the boiling-point the stimulating property, theine, would not be
extracted. Freshly boiled, because long cooking renders it flat and
insipid to taste on account of escape of its atmospheric gases. Tea
should always be infused, never boiled. Long steeping destroys the
delicate flavor by developing a larger amount of tannic acid.

\subsection*{How to Make Tea}


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item 3 teaspoons tea
\item 2 cups boiling water
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Scald an earthen or china teapot.

Put in tea, and pour on boiling water. Let stand on back of range or in
a warm place five minutes. Strain and serve immediately, with or without
sugar and milk. Avoid second steeping of leaves with addition of a few
fresh ones. If this is done, so large an amount of tannin is extracted
that various ills are apt to follow.

\subsection*{Five o'Clock Tea}

When tea is made in dining or drawing-room, a “Five o'Clock Tea-kettle”
(Samovar), and tea-ball or teapot are used.

\subsection*{Russian Tea}

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian Tea may be served hot or cold, but
always without milk. A thin slice of lemon, from which seeds have been
removed, or a few drops of lemon juice, is allowed for each cup. Sugar
is added according to taste. In Russia a preserved strawberry to each
cup is considered an improvement. We imitate our Russian friends by
garnishing with a candied cherry.

Make same as Iced Tea, having three crushed mint leaves in each glass
into which the hot infusion is strained.







\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Coffee}

The coffee-tree is native to Abyssinia, but is now grown in all tropical
countries. It belongs to the genus \textit{Coffea}, of which there are about
twenty-two species. The seeds of berries of coffee-trees constitute the
coffee of commerce. Each berry contains two seeds, with exception of
maleberry, which is a single round seed. In their natural state they are
almost tasteless; therefore color, shape, and size determine value.
Formerly, coffee was cured by exposure to the sun; but on account of
warm climate and sudden rainfalls, coffee was often injured. By the new
method coffee is washed, and then dried by steam heat.

In coffee plantations, trees are planted in parallel rows, from six to
eight feet apart, and are pruned so as never to exceed six feet in
height. Banana-trees are often grown in coffee plantations, advantage
being taken of their outspreading leaves, which protect coffee-trees
from direct rays of the sun. Brazil produces about two-thirds the coffee
used. Central America, Java, and Arabia are also coffee centres.

Tea comes to us ready for use; coffee needs roasting. In process of
roasting the seeds increase in size, but lose fifteen per cent in
weight. Roasting is necessary to develop the delightful aroma and
flavor. Java coffee is considered finest. Mocha commands a higher price,
owing to certain acidity and sparkle, which alone is not desirable; but
when combined with Java, in proportion of two parts Java to one part
Mocha, the coffee best suited to average taste is made. Some people
prefer Maleberry Java; so especial care is taken to have maleberries
separated, that they may be sold for higher price. Old Government Java
has deservedly gained a good reputation, as it is carefully inspected,
and its sale controlled by Dutch government. Strange as it may seem to
the consumer, all coffee sold as Java does not come from the island of
Java. Any coffee, wherever grown, having same characteristics and
flavor, is sold as Java. The same is true of other kinds of coffee.

The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alkaloid \textit{caffeine},
together with an essential oil. Like tea, it contains an astringent.
Coffee is more stimulating than tea, although, weight for weight, tea
contains about twice as much \textit{theine} as coffee contains \textit{caffeine}. The
smaller proportion of tea used accounts for the difference. A cup of
coffee with breakfast, and a cup of tea with supper, serve as a mild
stimulant for an adult, and form a valuable food adjunct, but should
never be found in the dietary of a child or dyspeptic. Coffee taken in
moderation quickens action of the heart, acts directly upon the nervous
system, and assists gastric digestion. Fatigue of body and mind are much
lessened by moderate use of coffee; severe exposure to cold can be
better endured by the coffee drinker. In times of war, coffee has proved
more valuable than alcoholic stimulants to keep up the enduring power of
soldiers. Coffee acts as an antidote for opium and alcoholic poisoning.
Tea and coffee are much more readily absorbed when taken on an empty
stomach; therefore this should be avoided except when used for medicinal
purposes. Coffee must be taken in moderation; its excessive use means
palpitation of the heart, tremor, insomnia, and nervous prostration.

Coffee is often adulterated with chiccory, beans, peas, and various
cereals, which are colored, roasted, and ground. By many, a small amount
of chiccory is considered an improvement, owing to the bitter principle
and volatile oil which it contains. Chiccory is void of caffeine. The
addition of chiccory may be detected by adding cold water to supposed
coffee; if chiccory is present, the liquid will be quickly discolored,
and chiccory will sink; pure coffee will float.


\textbf{Buying of Coffee.} Coffee should be bought for family use in small
quantities, freshly roasted and ground; or, if one has a coffee-mill, it
may be ground at home as needed. After being ground, unless kept air
tight, it quickly deteriorates. If not bought in air-tight cans, with
tight-fitting cover, or glass jar, it should be emptied into canister as
soon as brought from grocer's.

Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of coffee, or
decoction of coffee. Commonly speaking, boiled coffee is preferred, and
is more economical for the consumer. Coffee is ground fine, coarse, and
medium; and the grinding depends on the way in which it is to be made.
For filtered coffee have it finely ground; for boiled, coarse or medium.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Filtered Coffee}

                        (\textit{French or Percolated})


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item 1 cup coffee (finely ground)
\item 6 cups boiling water
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Various kinds of coffee pots are on the market for making filtered
coffee. They all contain a strainer to hold coffee without allowing
grounds to mix with infusion. Some have additional vessel to hold
boiling water, upon which coffee-pot may rest.

Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee-pot, and pot on the range.
Add gradually boiling water, and allow it to filter. Cover between
additions of water. If desired stronger, re-filter. Serve at once with
cut sugar and cream.

Put sugar and cream in cup before hot coffee. There will be perceptible
difference if cream is added last. If cream is not obtainable, scalded
milk may be substituted, or part milk and part cream may be used, if a
diluted cup of coffee is desired.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Boiled Coffee}


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item 1 cup coffee
\item 1 egg
\item 1 cup cold water
\item 6 cups boiling water
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Scald \textit{granite-ware} coffee-pot. Wash egg, break, and beat slightly.
Dilute with one-half the cold water, add crushed shell, and mix with
coffee. Turn into coffee-pot, pour on boiling water, and stir
thoroughly. Place on front of range, and boil three minutes. If not
boiled, coffee is cloudy; if boiled too long, too much tannic acid is
developed. The spout of pot should be covered or stuffed with soft paper
to prevent escape of fragrant aroma. Stir and pour some in a cup to be
sure that spout is free from grounds. Return to coffee-pot and repeat.
Add remaining cold water, which perfects clearing. Cold water being
heavier than hot water sinks to the bottom, carrying grounds with it.
Place on back of range for ten minutes, where coffee will not boil.
Serve at once. If any is left over, drain from grounds, and reserve for
making of jelly or other dessert.

Egg-shells may be saved and used for clearing coffee. Three egg-shells
are sufficient to effect clearing where one cup of ground coffee is
used. The shell performs no office in clearing except for the albumen
which clings to it. Burnett's Crystal Coffee Settler, or salt fish-skin,
washed, dried, and cut in inch pieces, is used for same purpose.

Coffee made with an egg has a rich flavor which egg alone can give.
Where strict economy is necessary, if great care is taken, egg may be
omitted. Coffee so made should be served from range, as much motion
causes it to become roiled.

Tin is an undesirable material for a coffee-pot, as tannic acid acts on
such metal and is apt to form a poisonous compound.

When coffee and scalded milk are served in equal proportions, it is
called \textit{Café au lait}. Coffee served with whipped cream is called
\textit{Vienna Coffee}.

\textbf{To Make a Small Pot of Coffee.} Mix one cup ground coffee with one egg,
slightly beaten, and crushed shell. To one-third of this amount add
one-third cup cold water. Turn into a scalded coffee-pot, add one pint
boiling water, and boil three minutes. Let stand on back of range ten
minutes; serve. Keep remaining coffee and egg closely covered, in a cool
place, to use two successive mornings.

\textbf{To Make Coffee for One.} Allow two tablespoons ground coffee to one cup
cold water. Add coffee to cold water, cover closely, and let stand over
night. In the morning bring to a boiling-point. If carefully poured, a
clear cup of coffee may be served.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{After-Dinner Coffee}

                     (\textit{Black Coffee, or Café Noir})

For after-dinner coffee use twice the quantity of coffee, or half the
amount of liquid, given in previous recipes. Filtered coffee is often
preferred where milk or cream is not used, as is always the case with
black coffee. Serve in after-dinner coffee cups, with or without cut
sugar.

Coffee retards gastric digestion; but where the stomach has been
overtaxed by a hearty meal, café noir may prove beneficial, so great are
its stimulating effects.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Kola}

The preparations on the market made from the kola-nut have much the same
effect upon the system as coffee and chocolate, inasmuch as they contain
caffeine and theobromine; they are also valuable for their diastase and
a milk-digesting ferment.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Cocoa And Chocolate}

The cacao-tree (\textit{Theobroma cacao}) is native to Mexico. Although
successfully cultivated between the twentieth parallels of latitude, its
industry is chiefly confined to Mexico, South America, and the West
Indies. Cocoa and chocolate are both prepared from seeds of the cocoa
bean. The bean pod is from seven to ten inches long, and three to four
and one-half inches in diameter. Each pod contains from twenty to forty
seeds, imbedded in mucilaginous material. Cocoa beans are dried previous
to importation. Like coffee, they need roasting to develop flavor. After
roasting, outer covering of bean is removed; this covering makes what is
known as \textit{cocoa shells}, which have little nutritive value. The beans
are broken and sold as \textit{cocoa nibs}.

The various preparations of cocoa on the market are made from the ground
cocoa nibs, from which, by means of hydraulic pressure, a large amount
of fat is expressed, leaving a solid cake. This in turn is pulverized
and mixed with sugar, and frequently a small amount of corn-starch or
arrowroot. To some preparations cinnamon or vanilla is added. Broma
contains both arrowroot and cinnamon.

Chocolate is made from cocoa nibs, but contains a much larger proportion
of fat than cocoa preparations. Bitter, sweet, or flavored chocolate is
always sold in cakes.

The fat obtained from cocoa bean is \textit{cocoa butter}, which gives cocoa
its principal nutrient.

Cocoa and chocolate differ from tea and coffee inasmuch as they contain
nutriment as well as stimulant. \textit{Theobromine}, the active principle, is
almost identical with theine and caffeine in its composition and
effects.

Many people who abstain from the use of tea and coffee find cocoa
indispensable. Not only is it valuable for its own nutriment, but for
the large amount of milk added to it. Cocoa may be well placed in the
dietary of a child after his third year, while chocolate should be
avoided as a beverage, but may be given as a confection. Invalids and
those of weak digestion can take cocoa where chocolate would prove too
rich.

\chapter{Bread And Bread Making}



Bread is the most important article of food, and history tells of its
use thousands of years before the Christian era. Many processes have
been employed in making and baking; and as a result, from the first flat
cake has come the perfect loaf. The study of bread making is of no
slight importance, and deserves more attention than it receives.

Considering its great value, it seems unnecessary and wrong to find poor
bread on the table; and would that our standard might be raised as high
as that of our friends across the water! Who does not appreciate the
loaf produced by the French baker, who has worked months to learn the
art of bread making?

Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by addition of
water, salt, and a ferment. Wheat flour is best adapted for bread
making, as it contains gluten in the right proportion to make the spongy
loaf. But for its slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect
food; hence arose the custom of spreading it with butter. It should be
remembered, in speaking of wheat bread as perfect food, that it must be
made of flour rich in gluten. Next to wheat flour ranks rye in
importance for bread making; but it is best used in combination with
wheat, for alone it makes heavy, sticky, moist bread. Corn also needs to
be used in combination with wheat for bread making, for if used alone
the bread will be crumbly.

The miller, in order to produce flour which will make the white loaf (so
sightly to many), in the process of grinding wheat has been forced to
remove the inner bran coats, so rich in mineral matter, and much of the
gluten intimately connected with them.

To understand better the details of bread making, wheat, from which
bread is principally made, should be considered.

A grain of wheat consists of (1) an outer covering or husk, which is
always removed before milling; (2) bran coats, which contain mineral
matter; (3) gluten, the protein matter and fat; and (4) starch, the
centre and largest part of the grain. Wheat is distinguished as \textit{white}
and \textit{soft}, or \textit{red} and \textit{hard}. The former is known as \textit{winter wheat},
having been sown in the fall, and living through the winter; the latter
is known as \textit{spring wheat}, having been sown in the spring. From winter
wheat, pastry flour, sometimes called St. Louis, is made; from spring
wheat, bread flour, also called Haxall. St. Louis flour takes its name
from the old process of grinding; Haxall, from the name of the inventor
of the new process. All flours are now milled by the same process. For
difference in composition of wheat flours, consult table in Chapter VI
on Cereals.

Wheat is milled for converting into flour by processes producing
essentially the same results, all requiring cleansing, grinding, and
bolting. Entire wheat flour has only the outer husk removed, the
remainder of the kernel being finely ground. \textit{Graham flour}, confounded
with entire wheat, is too often found to be an inferior flour, mixed
with coarse bran.

Grinding is accomplished by one of four systems: (1) low milling; (2)
Hungarian system, or high milling; (3) roller-milling; and (4) by a
machine known as disintegrator.

\textbf{In low milling process}, grooved stones are employed for grinding. The
stones are enclosed in a metal case, and provision is made within case
for passage of air to prevent wheat from becoming overheated. The lower
stone being permanently fixed, the upper stone being so balanced above
it that grooves may exactly correspond, when upper stone rotates, sharp
edges of grooves meet each other, and operate like a pair of scissors.
By this process flour is made ready for bolting by one grinding.

\textbf{In high milling process}, grooved stones are employed, but are kept so
far apart that at first the wheat is only bruised, and a series of
grindings and siftings is necessary. This process is applicable only to
the hardest wheats, and is partially supplanted by roller-milling.

\textbf{In roller-milling}, wheat is subjected to action of a pair of steel or
chilled-iron horizontal rollers, having toothed surfaces. They revolve
in opposite directions, at different rates of speed, and have a cutting
action.

Porcelain rollers, with rough surfaces, are sometimes employed. In this
system, grinding is accomplished by cutting rather than crushing.

“The \textbf{disintegrator} consists of a pair of circular metal disks, set
face to face, studded with circles of projecting bars so arranged that
circles of bars on one disk alternate with those of the other. The disks
are mounted on the same centre, and so closely set to one another that
projecting bars of one disk come quite close to plane surface of the
other. They are enclosed within an external casing. The disks are caused
to rotate in opposite directions with great rapidity, and the grain is
almost instantaneously reduced to a powder.”

After grinding comes bolting, by which process the different grades of
flour are obtained. The ground wheat is placed in octagonal cylinders
(covered with silk or linen bolting-cloth of different degrees of
fineness), which are allowed to rotate, thus forcing the wheat through.
The flour from first siftings contains the largest percentage of gluten.

Flour is branded under different names to suit manufacturer or dealer.
In consequence, the same wheat, milled by the same process, makes flour
which is sold under different names.

In buying flour, whether bread or pastry, select the best kept by your
grocer. Some of the well-known brands of bread flour are King Arthur,
Swan's Down, Bridal Veil, Columbia, Washburn's Extra, and Pillbury's
Best; of pastry, Best St. Louis. Bread flour should be used in all cases
where yeast is called for, with few exceptions; in other cases, pastry
flour. The difference between bread and pastry flour may be readily
determined. Take bread flour in the hand, close hand tightly, then open,
and flour will not keep in shape; if allowed to pass through fingers it
will feel slightly granular. Take pastry flour in the hand, close hand
tightly, open, and flour will be in shape, having impression of the
lines of the hand, and feeling soft and velvety to touch. Flour should
always be sifted before measuring.

\textbf{Entire wheat flour} differs from ordinary flour inasmuch as it contains
all the gluten found in wheat, the outer husk of kernels only being
removed, the remainder ground to different degrees of fineness and left
unbolted. Such flours are sold by the different health food companies,
who have agencies in the large cities. Franklin Mills, Old Grist Mill,
and Health Food flours are included in this class.

\textbf{Gluten}, the protein of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic substance,
insoluble in water. On account of its great power of expansion, it holds
the gas developed in bread dough by fermentation, which otherwise would
escape.

\section*{Yeast}

Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is the lowest form
of vegetable life. It consists of spores, or germs, found floating in
air, and belongs to a family of which there are many species. These
spores grow by budding and division, and multiply very rapidly under
favorable conditions, and produce fermentation.

\textbf{Fermentation} is the process by which, under influence of air, warmth,
moisture, and some ferment, sugar (or dextrose, starch converted into
sugar) is changed into alcohol (C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{5}HO) and carbon dioxide
(CO\textsubscript{2}). The product of all fermentation is the same. Three kinds are
considered,--alcoholic, acetic, and lactic. Where bread dough is allowed
to ferment by addition of yeast, the fermentation is \textit{alcoholic}; where
alcoholic fermentation continues too long, \textit{acetic} fermentation sets
in, which is a continuation of alcoholic. \textit{Lactic} fermentation is
fermentation which takes place when milk sours.

Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for raising bread. The
compressed yeast cakes done up in tinfoil have long proved satisfactory,
and are now almost universally used, having replaced the home-made
liquid yeast. Never use a yeast cake unless perfectly fresh, which may
be determined by its light color and absence of dark streaks.

The \textit{yeast plant} is killed at 212deg F.; life is suspended, but not
entirely destroyed, 32deg F. The temperature best suited for its growth is
from 65deg to 68deg F. The most favorable conditions for the growth of yeast
are a warm, moist, sweet, nitrogenous soil. These must be especially
considered in bread making.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Bread Making}

\textbf{Fermented bread} is made by mixing to a dough, flour, with a definite
quantity of water, milk, or water and milk, salt, and a ferment. Sugar
is usually added to hasten fermentation. Dough is then kneaded that the
ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated, covered, and allowed to rise
in a temperature of 68deg F., until dough has doubled its bulk. This
change has been caused by action of the ferment, which attacks some of
the starch in flour, and changes it to sugar, and sugar in turn to
alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus lightening the whole mass. Dough is
then kneaded a second time to break bubbles and distribute evenly the
carbon dioxide. It is shaped in loaves, put in greased bread pans (they
being half filled), covered, allowed to rise in temperature same as for
first rising, to double its bulk. If risen too long, it will be full of
large holes; if not risen long enough, it will be heavy and soggy. If
pans containing loaves are put in too hot a place while rising, a heavy
streak will be found near bottom of loaf.

\textbf{How to Shape Loaves and Biscuits.} To shape bread dough in loaves,
divide dough in parts, each part large enough for a loaf, knead until
smooth, and if possible avoid seams in under part of loaf. If baked in
brick pan, place two loaves in one pan, brushed between with a little
melted butter. If baked in long shallow pan, when well kneaded, roll
with both hands to lengthen, care being taken that it is smooth and of
uniform thickness. Where long loaves are baked on sheets, shape and roll
loosely in a towel sprinkled with corn meal for last rising.

To shape bread dough in biscuits, pull or cut off as many small pieces
(having them of uniform size) as there are to be biscuits. Flour palms
of hands slightly; take up each piece and shape separately, lifting,
with thumb and first two fingers of right hand, and placing in palm of
left hand, constantly moving dough round and round, while folding
towards the centre; when smooth, turn it over and roll between palms of
hands. Place in greased pans near together, brushed between with a
little melted butter, which will cause biscuits to separate easily after
baking. For finger rolls, shape biscuits and roll with one hand on part
of board where there is no flour, until of desired length, care being
taken to make smooth, of uniform size, and round at ends.

Biscuits may be shaped in a great variety of ways, but they should
always be small. Large biscuits, though equally good, never tempt one by
their daintiness.

Bread is often brushed over with milk before baking, to make a darker
crust.

Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece of yeast cake
must be used; one-fourth yeast cake to one pint liquid is sufficient,
one-third yeast cake to one quart liquid. Bread mixed and baked during
the day requires a larger quantity of yeast; one yeast cake, or
sometimes even more, to one pint of liquid. Bread dough mixed with a
large quantity of yeast should be watched during rising, and cut down as
soon as mixture doubles its bulk. If proper care is taken, the bread
will be found most satisfactory, having neither “yeasty” nor sour taste.

Fermented bread was formerly raised by means of leaven.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Baking Of Bread}

Bread is baked: (1) To kill ferment, (2) to make soluble the starch, (3)
to drive off alcohol and carbon dioxide, and (4) to form brown crust of
pleasant flavor. Bread should be baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too
hot the crust will brown quickly before the heat has reached the centre,
and prevent further rising; loaf should continue rising for first
fifteen minutes of baking, when it should begin to brown, and continue
browning for the next twenty minutes. The last fifteen minutes it should
finish baking, when the heat may be reduced. When bread is done, it will
not cling to sides of pan, and may be easily removed. Biscuits require
more heat than loaf bread, should continue rising the first five
minutes, and begin to brown in eight minutes. Experience is the best
guide for testing temperature of oven. Various oven thermometers have
been made, but none have proved practical. Bread may be brushed over
with melted butter, three minutes before removal from oven, if a more
tender crust is desired.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Care Of Bread After Baking}

Remove loaves at once from pans, and place side down on a wire bread or
cake cooler. If a crisp crust is desired, allow bread to cool without
covering; if soft crust, cover with a towel during cooling. When cool,
put in tin box or stone jar, and cover closely.

Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will absorb moisture and
transmit an unpleasant taste to bread. Bread tins or jars should be
washed and scalded twice a week in winter, and every other day in
summer; otherwise bread is apt to mould. As there are so many ways of
using small and stale pieces of bread, care should be taken that none is
wasted.

\textbf{Unfermented bread} is raised without a ferment, the carbon dioxide
being produced by the use of soda (alkaline salt) and an acid. Soda,
employed in combination with cream of tartar, for raising mixtures, in
proportion of one-third soda to two-thirds cream of tartar, was formerly
used to a great extent, but has been generally superseded by baking
powder.

\textbf{Soda bicarbonate} (NaHCO\textsubscript{3}) is manufactured from sodium chloride
(NaCl), common salt or cryolite.

\textbf{Baking powder} is composed of soda and cream of tartar in definite,
correct proportions, mixed with small quantity of dry material (flour or
corn-starch) to keep action from taking place. If found to contain alum
or ammonia, it is impure. In using baking powder, allow two teaspoons
baking powder to each cup of flour, when eggs are not used; to egg
mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoons baking powder. When a recipe
calls for soda and cream of tartar, in substituting baking powder use
double amount of cream of tartar given.

These rules apply to the various soda and cream of tartar baking powders
on the market. Horsford's Baking Powder, the only mineral one, requires
one-third less than others.

Soda and cream of tartar, or baking powder mixtures, are made light by
liberation of gas in mixture; the gas in soda is set free by the acid in
cream of tartar; in order to accomplish this, moisture and heat are both
required. As soon as moisture is added to baking powder mixtures, the
gas will begin to escape; hence the necessity of baking as soon as
possible. If baking powder only is used for raising, put mixture to be
cooked in a hot oven.

\textbf{Cream of tartar} (HKC\textsubscript{4}O\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{4}) is obtained from argols found
adhering to bottom and sides of wine casks, which are ninety per cent
cream of tartar. The argols are ground and dissolved in boiling water,
coloring matter removed by filtering through animal charcoal, and by a
process of recrystallization the cream of tartar of commerce is
obtained.

The acid found in molasses, sour milk, and lemon juice will liberate gas
in soda, but the action is much quicker than when cream of tartar is
used.

Fermented and unfermented breads are raised to be made light and porous,
that they may be easily acted upon by the digestive ferments. Some
mixtures are made light by beating sufficiently to enclose a large
amount of air, and when baked in a hot oven air is forced to expand.

\textbf{Aerated bread} is made light by carbon dioxide forced into dough under
pressure. The carbon dioxide is generated from sulphuric acid and lime.
Aerated bread is of close texture, and has a flavor peculiar to itself.
It is a product of the baker's skill, but has found little favor except
in few localities.

knead quickly, but the motion once acquired will never be forgotten.
Return to bowl, cover with a clean cloth kept for the purpose, and board
or tin cover; let rise over night in temperature of 65deg F. In morning
cut down: this is accomplished by cutting through and turning over dough
several times with a case knife, and checks fermentation for a short
time; dough may be again raised, and recut down if it is not convenient
to shape into loaves or biscuits after first cutting. When properly
cared for, bread need never sour. Toss on board slightly floured, knead,
shape into loaves or biscuits, place in greased pans, having pans nearly
half full. Cover, let rise again to double its bulk, and bake in hot
oven. (See Baking of Bread and Time Table for Baking.) This recipe will

three-fourths cups white flour. The dough should be slightly kneaded,
and if handled quickly will not stick to board. Loaves and biscuits
should be shaped with hands instead of pouring into pans, as in Entire
Wheat Bread.

Add butter, sugar, and salt to milk; when lukewarm, add dissolved yeast
cake and three cups of flour. Beat thoroughly, cover, and let rise until
light; cut down, and add enough flour to knead (it will take about two
and one-half cups). Let rise again, toss on slightly floured board,
knead, pat, and roll out to one-third inch thickness. Shape with
biscuit-cutter, first dipped in flour. Dip the handle of a case knife in
flour, and with it make a crease through the middle of each piece; brush
over one-half of each piece with melted butter, fold, and press edges
together. Place in greased pan, one inch apart, cover, let rise, and
bake in hot oven twelve to fifteen minutes. As rolls rise they will part
slightly, and if hastened in rising are apt to lose their shape.





Parker House Rolls may be shaped by cutting or tearing off small pieces
of dough, and shaping round like a biscuit; place in rows on floured
board, cover, and let rise fifteen minutes. With handle of large wooden

\section*{Uses For Stale Bread}

All pieces of bread should be saved and utilized. Large pieces are best
for toast. Soft stale bread, from which crust is removed, when crumbed,
is called stale breadcrumbs, or raspings, and is used for puddings,
griddle-cakes, omelets, scalloped dishes, and dipping food to be fried.
Remnants of bread, from which crusts have not been removed, are dried in
oven, rolled, and sifted. These are called dry bread crumbs, and are
useful for crumbing croquettes, cutlets, fish, meat, etc.

\chapter{Cereals}



Cereals (cultivated grasses) rank first among vegetable foods; being of
hardy growth and easy cultivation, they are more widely diffused over
the globe than any of the flowering plants. They include wheat, oats,
rye, barley, maize (Indian corn), and rice; some authorities place
buckwheat among them. Wheat probably is the most largely consumed; next
to wheat, comes rice.

\textit{Macaroni}, \textit{spaghetti}, and \textit{vermicelli} are made from wheaten flour,
rich in gluten, moistened to a stiff dough with water, and forced
through small apertures in an iron plate by means of a screw press.
Various Italian pastes are made from the same mixture. Macaroni is
manufactured to some extent in this country, but the best comes from
Italy, Lagana and Pejero, being the favorite brand. When macaroni is
colored, it is done by the use of saffron, not by eggs, as is generally
supposed. The only egg macaroni is manufactured in strips, and comes
from Minneapolis.

Macaroni is valuable food, as it is very cheap and nutritious; but being
deficient in fat, it should be combined with cream, butter, or cheese,
to make a perfect food.

From cereals many preparations are made, used alone, or in combination
with other food products. From rice is made rice flour; from oats,
oatmeal, and oats steam-cooked and rolled,--as Rolled Avena, Quaker
Rolled Oats, H-O, etc. There are many species of corn, the principal
varieties being white, yellow, and red. From corn is made corn
meal,--both white and yellow,--corn-starch, hominy, maizena, cerealine,
samp, and hulled corn; from wheat, wheaten or white flour, Wheatena,
Wheatlet, Rolled Wheat, Pettijohn's, etc. Rye is used for Rye Flakes,
meal, and flour; barley, for flour and pearl barley. Buckwheat,
throughout the United States, is used only when made into flour for
buckwheat cakes.

For family use, cereals should be bought in small quantities, and kept
in glass jars, tightly covered. Many cereal preparations are on the
market for making breakfast mushes, put up in one and two pound
packages, with directions for cooking. In nearly all cases, time allowed
for cooking is not sufficient, unless dish containing cereal is brought
in direct contact with fire, which is not the best way. Mushes should be
cooked over hot water after the first five minutes; if a double boiler
is not procurable, improvise one. Boiling water and salt should always
be added to cereals, allowing one teaspoon salt to each cup of
cereal,--boiled to soften cellulose and swell starch-grains, salted to
give flavor. Indian meal and finely ground preparations should be mixed
with cold water before adding boiling water, to prevent lumping.

\noindent
Eggs, like milk, form a typical food, inasmuch as they contain all the
elements, in the right proportion, necessary for the support of the
body. Their highly concentrated, nutritive value renders it necessary to
use them in combination with other foods rich in starch (bread,
potatoes, etc.). In order that the stomach may have enough to act upon,
a certain amount of bulk must be furnished.

A pound of eggs (nine) is equivalent in nutritive value to a pound of
beef. From this it may be seen that eggs, at even twenty-five cents per
dozen, should not be freely used by the strict economist. Eggs being
rich in protein serve as a valuable substitute for meat. In most
families, their use in the making of cake, custard, puddings, etc.,
renders them almost indispensable. It is surprising how many intelligent
women, who look well to the affairs of the kitchen, are satisfied to use
what are termed “cooking eggs”; this shows poor judgment from an
economical standpoint. Strictly fresh eggs should always be used if
obtainable. An egg after the first twenty-four hours steadily
deteriorates. If exposed to air, owing to the porous structure of the
shell, there is an evaporation of water, air rushes in, and
decomposition takes place.

White of egg contains albumen in its purest form. Albumen coagulates at
a temperature of from 134deg to 160deg F. Herein lies the importance of
cooking eggs at a low temperature, thus rendering them easy of
digestion. Eggs cooked in boiling water are tough and horny, difficult
of digestion, and should never be served.

When eggs come from the market, they should be washed, and put away in a
cold place.

\textbf{Ways of Determining Freshness of Eggs.} 

I. Hold in front of candle flame in dark room, and the centre should look clear.

II. Place in basin of cold water, and they should sink.

III. Place large end to the cheek, and a warmth should be felt.

\textbf{Ways of Keeping Eggs.} 

I. Pack in sawdust, small end down.

II. Keep in lime water.

III. From July to September a large number of eggs are packed, small
ends down, in cases having compartments, one for each egg, and kept in
cold storage. Eggs are often kept in cold storage six months, and then
sold as cooking eggs.

\section*{Boiled Eggs}

Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. Carefully put in with a
spoon the number of eggs desired, covering them with water. Remove
saucepan to back of range, where water will not boil. Cook from six to
eight minutes if liked “soft-boiled,” forty to forty-five if liked
“hard-boiled.” Eggs may be cooked by placing in cold water and allowing
water to heat gradually until the boiling-point is reached, when they
will be “soft-boiled.” In using hard-boiled eggs for making other
dishes, when taken from the hot water they should be plunged into cold
water to prevent, if possible, discoloration of yolks.

Eggs perfectly cooked should be placed and kept in water at a uniform
temperature of 175deg F.

\section*{Dropped Eggs (Poached)}

Have ready a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling salted water,
allowing one-half tablespoon salt to one quart of water. Put two or
three buttered muffin rings in the water. Break each egg separately into
a cup, and carefully slip into a muffin ring. The water should cover the
eggs. When there is a film over the top, and the white is firm,
carefully remove with a buttered skimmer to circular pieces of buttered
toast, and let each person season his own egg with butter, salt, and
pepper. If cooked for an invalid, garnish with four toast points and a
bit of parsley. An egg-poacher may be used instead of muffin rings.

\chapter{Soups}



It cannot be denied that the French excel all nations in the excellence
of their cuisine, and to their soups and sauces belong the greatest
praise. It would be well to follow their example, and it is the duty of
every housekeeper to learn the art of soup making. How may a hearty
dinner be better begun than with a thin soup? The hot liquid, taken into
an empty stomach, is easily assimilated, acts as a stimulant rather than
a nutrient (as is the popular opinion), and prepares the way for the
meal which is to follow. The cream soups and purées are so nutritious
that, with bread and butter, they furnish a satisfactory meal.

Soups are divided into two great classes: soups with stock; soups
without stock.

Soups with stock have, for their basis, beef, veal, mutton, fish,
poultry, or game, separately or in combination. They are classified as:

\textbf{Bouillon}, made from lean beef, delicately seasoned, and usually
cleared. Exception,--clam bouillon.

\textbf{Brown Soup Stock}, made from beef (two-thirds lean meat, and remainder
bone and fat), highly seasoned with vegetables, spices, and sweet herbs.

\textbf{White Soup Stock}, made from chicken or veal, with delicate seasonings.

\textbf{Consommé}, usually made from two or three kinds of meat (beef, veal,
and fowl being employed), highly seasoned with vegetables, spices, and
sweet herbs. Always served clear.

\textbf{Lamb Stock}, delicately seasoned, is served as mutton broth.

Soups without stock are classified as:

\textbf{Cream Soups}, made of vegetables or fish, with milk, and a small amount
of cream and seasonings. Always thickened.

\textbf{Purées}, made from vegetables or fish, forced through a strainer, and
retained in soup, milk, and seasonings. Generally thicker than cream
soup. Sometimes White Stock is added.

\textbf{Bisques}, generally made from shell-fish, milk, and seasonings, and
served with fish dice; made similarly to purées. They may be made of
meat, game, or vegetables, with small dice of the same.

Various names have been given to soups, according to their flavorings,
chief ingredients, the people who use them, etc. To the Scotch belongs
Scotch Broth; to the French, Pot-au-feu; to the Indo, Mulligatawny; and
to the Spanish, Olla Podrida.

\section*{Soup Making}

The art of soup making is more easily mastered than at first appears.
The young housekeeper is startled at the amazingly large number of
ingredients the recipe calls for, and often is discouraged. One may,
with but little expense, keep at hand what is essential for the making
of a good soup. Winter vegetables--turnips, carrots, celery, and
onions--may be bought in large or small quantities. The outer stalks of
celery, often not suitable for serving, should be saved for soups. At
seasons when celery is a luxury, the tips and roots should be saved and
dried. Sweet herbs, including thyme, savory, and marjoram, are dried and
put up in packages, retailing from five to ten cents. Bay leaves, which
should be used sparingly, may be obtained at first-class grocers' or
druggists'; seeming never to lose strength, they may be kept
indefinitely. Spices, including whole cloves, allspice berries,
peppercorns, and stick cinnamon, should be kept on hand. These
seasonings, with the addition of salt, pepper, and parsley, are the
essential flavorings for stock soups. Flour, corn-starch, arrowroot,
fine tapioca, sago, pearl barley, rice, bread, or eggs are added to give
consistency and nourishment.

In small families, where there are few left-overs, fresh meat must be
bought for the making of soup stock, as a good soup cannot be made from
a small amount of poor material. On the other hand, large families need
seldom buy fresh meat, provided all left-overs are properly cared for.
The soup kettle should receive small pieces of beef (roasted, broiled,
or stewed), veal, carcasses of fowl or chicken, chop bones, bones left
from lamb roast, and all trimmings and bones, which a careful housewife
should see are sent from the market with her order. Avoid the use of
smoked or corned meats, or large pieces of raw mutton or lamb surrounded
by fat, on account of the strong flavor so disagreeable to many. A small
piece of bacon or lean ham is sometimes cooked with vegetables for
flavor.

Beef ranks first as regards utility and economy in soup making. It
should be cut from the fore or hind shin (which cuts contain
marrow-bone), the middle cuts being most desirable. If the lower part of
shin is used, the soup, although rich in gelatin, lacks flavor, unless a
cheap piece of lean meat is used with it, which frequently is done. It
must be remembered that meat, bone, and fat in the right proportions are
all necessary; allow two-thirds lean meat, the remaining one-third bone
and fat. From the meat the soluble juices, salts, extractives (which
give color and flavor), and a small quantity of gelatin are extracted;
from the bone, gelatin (which gives the stock when cold a jelly-like
consistency) and mineral matter. Gelatin is also obtained from
cartilage, skin, tendons, and ligaments. Some of the fat is absorbed;
the remainder rises to the top and should be removed.

Soup stock making is rendered easier by use of proper utensils. Sharp
meat knives, hardwood board, two purée strainers having meshes of
different size, and a soup digester (a porcelain-lined iron pot, having
tight-fitting cover, with valve in the top), or covered granite kettle,
are essentials. An iron kettle, which formerly constituted one of the
furnishings of a range, may be used if perfectly smooth. A saw, cleaver,
and scales, although not necessary, are useful, and lighten labor.

When meat comes from market, remove from paper and put in cool place.
When ready to start stock, if scales are at hand, weigh meat and bone to
see if correct proportions have been sent. Wipe meat with clean
cheese-cloth wrung out of cold water. Cut lean meat in one-inch cubes;
by so doing, a large amount of surface is exposed to the water, and
juices are more easily drawn out. Heat frying-pan hissing hot; remove
marrow from marrow-bone, and use enough to brown one-third of the lean
meat, stirring constantly, that all parts of surface may be seared, thus
preventing escape of juices,--sacrificing a certain amount of goodness in
the stock to give additional color and flavor, which is obtained by
caramelization. Put fat, bone, and remaining lean meat in soup kettle;
cover with cold water, allowing one pint to each pound of meat, bone,
and fat. Let stand one hour, that cold water may draw out juices from
meat. Add browned meat, taking water from soup kettle to rinse out
frying-pan, that none of the coloring may be lost. Heat gradually to
boiling-point, and cook six or seven hours at low temperature. A scum
will rise on the top, which contains coagulated albuminous juices; these
give to soup its chief nutritive value; many, however, prefer a clear
soup, and have them removed. If allowed to remain, when straining, a
large part will pass through strainer. Vegetables, spices, and salt
should be added the last hour of cooking. Strain and cool quickly; by so
doing, stock is less apt to ferment. A knuckle of veal is often used for
making white soup stock. Fowl should be used for stock in preference to
chicken, as it is cheaper, and contains a larger amount of nutriment. A
cake of fat forms on stock when cold, which excludes air, and should not
be removed until stock is used. To remove fat, run a knife around edge
of bowl and carefully remove the same. A small quantity will remain,
which should be removed by passing a cloth wrung out of hot water around
edge and over top of stock. This fat should be clarified and used for
drippings. If time cannot be allowed for stock to cool before using,
take off as much fat as possible with a spoon, and remove the remainder
by passing tissue or any absorbent paper over the surface.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{How to Clear Soup Stock}

Whites of eggs slightly beaten, or raw, lean beef finely chopped, are
employed for clearing soup stock. The albumen found in each effects the
clearing by drawing to itself some of the juices which have been
extracted from the meat, and by action of heat have been coagulated.
Some rise to the top and form a scum, others are precipitated.

Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared in stewpan,
allowing white and shell of one egg to each quart of stock. Beat egg
slightly, break shell in small pieces and add to stock. Place on front
of range, and stir constantly until boiling-point is reached; boil two
minutes. Set back where it may simmer twenty minutes; remove scum, and
strain through double thickness of cheese-cloth placed over a fine
strainer. If stock to be cleared is not sufficiently seasoned,
additional seasoning must be added as soon as stock has lost its
jelly-like consistency; not after clearing is effected. Many think the
flavor obtained from a few shavings of lemon rind an agreeable addition.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{How to Bind Soups}

Cream soups and purées, if allowed to stand, separate, unless bound
together. To bind a soup, melt butter, and when bubbling add an equal
quantity of flour; when well mixed add to boiling soup, stirring
constantly. If recipe calls for more flour than butter, or soup is one
that should be made in double boiler, add gradually a portion of hot
mixture to butter and flour until of such consistency that it may be
poured into the mixture remaining in double boiler.

\chapter{Fish}



The meat of fish is the animal food next in importance to that of birds
and mammals. Fish meat, with but few exceptions, is less stimulating and
nourishing than meat of other animals, but is usually easier of
digestion. Salmon, mackerel, and eels are exceptions to these rules, and
should not be eaten by those of weak digestion. White fish, on account
of their easy digestibility, are especially desirable for those of
sedentary habits. Fish is not recommended for brain-workers on account
of the large amount of phosphorus (an element abounding largely in nerve
tissue) which it contains, but because of its easy digestibility. It is
a conceded fact that many fish contain less of this element than meat.

Fish meat is generally considered cheaper than meat of other animals.
This is true when compared with the better cuts of meat, but not so when
compared with cheaper cuts.

To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it should be eaten
fresh, and in season. Turbot, which is improved by keeping, is the only
exception to this rule.

\textit{To Determine Freshness of Fish.} Examine the flesh, and it should be
firm; the eyes and gills, and they should be bright.

Broiling and baking are best methods for cooking fish. White fish may
often be fried, but oily rarely. Frozen fish are undesirable, but if
used, should be thawed in cold water just before cooking.

On account of its strong odor, fish should never be put in an ice-box
with other food, unless closely covered. A tin lard pail will be found
useful for this purpose.

\section*{White And Oily Fish}

White fish have fat secreted in the liver. Examples: cod, haddock,
trout, flounder, smelt, perch, etc.

Oily fish have fat distributed throughout the flesh. Examples: salmon,
eels, mackerel, bluefish, swordfish, shad, herring, etc.

\textbf{Cod} belongs to one of the most prolific fish families (Gadidoe), and
is widely distributed throughout the northern and temperate seas of both
hemispheres. On account of its abundance, cheapness, and easy
procurability, it forms, from an economical standpoint, one of the most
important fish foods. Cod have been caught weighing over a hundred
pounds, but average market cod weigh from six to ten pounds; a six-pound
cod measures about twenty-three inches in length. Large cod are cut into
steaks. The skin of cod is white, heavily mottled with gray, with a
white line running the entire length of fish on either side. Cod is
caught in shallow or deep waters. Shallow-water cod (caught off rocks)
is called rock cod; deep-water cod is called off-shore cod. Rock cod are
apt to be wormy. Cod obtained off George's Banks, Newfoundland, are
called George's cod, and are commercially known as the best fish.
Quantities of cod are preserved by drying and salting. Salted George's
cod is the best brand on the market. Cod is in season throughout the
year.

\textit{Cod Liver Oil} is obtained from cods' livers, and has great therapeutic
value. Isinglass, made from swimming bladder of cod, nearly equals in
quality that made from bladder of sturgeon.


      \textbf{Haddock} is more closely allied to cod than any other fish.

It is smaller (its average weight being about four pounds), and
differently mottled. The distinguishing mark of the haddock is a black
line running the entire length of fish on either side. Haddock is found
in the same water and in company with cod, but not so abundantly. Like
cod, haddock is cheap, and in season throughout the year. Haddock, when
dried, smoked, and salted, is known as \textit{Finnan Haddie}.

\textbf{Halibut} is the largest of the flatfish family (Pleuronectidæ),
specimens having been caught weighing from three to four hundred pounds.
Small, or chicken, halibut is the kind usually found in market, and
weighs from fifteen to twenty-five pounds. Halibut are distinctively
cold-water fish, being caught in water at from 32deg to 45deg F. They are
found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, where they are
nearly identical. The halibut has a compressed body, the skin on one
side being white, on the other light, or dark gray, and both eyes are
found on the dark side of head. Halibut is in season throughout the
year.

\textbf{Turbot} (called little halibut) is a species of the flatfish family,
being smaller than halibut, and of more delicate flavor. Turbot are in
season from January to March.

\textbf{Flounder} is a small flatfish, which closely resembles the sole which
is caught in English waters, and is often served under that name.

\textbf{Trout} are generally fresh water fish, varying much in size and
skin-coloring. Lake trout, which are the largest, reach their greatest
perfection in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, but are found in many
lakes. Salmon trout is the name applied to trout caught in New York
lakes. Brook trout, caught in brooks and small lakes, are superior
eating. Trout are in season from April to August, but a few are found
later.

\textbf{Whitefish} is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes.

\textbf{Smelts} are small salt-water fish, and are usually caught in temperate
waters at the mouths of rivers. New Brunswick and Maine send large
quantities of smelts to market. Selected smelts are the largest in size,
and command higher price. The Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Law
forbids their sale from March 15th to June 1st. Smelts are always sold
by the pound.

\textbf{Bluefish} belongs to the Pomatomidæ family. It is widely distributed in
temperate waters, taking different names in different localities. In New
England and the Middle States it is generally called Bluefish, although
in some parts called Snappers, or Snapping Mackerel. In the Southern
States it is called Greenfish. It is in season in our markets from May
to October; as it is frozen and kept in cold storage from six to nine
months, it may be obtained throughout the year. The heavier the fish,
the better its quality. Bluefish weigh from one to eight pounds, and are
from fourteen to twenty-nine inches in length.

\textbf{Mackerel} is one of the best-known food fishes, and is caught in North
Atlantic waters. Its skin is lustrous dark blue above, with wavy
blackish lines, and silvery below. It sometimes attains a length of
eighteen inches, but is usually less. Mackerel weigh from three-fourths
of a pound to two pounds, and are sold by the piece. They are in season
from May 1st to September 1st. Mackerel, when first in market, contain
less fat than later in the season, therefore are easier of digestion.
The supply of mackerel varies greatly from year to year, and some years
is very small. \textit{Spanish mackerel} are found in waters farther south than
common mackerel, and in our markets command higher price.

\textbf{Salmon} live in both fresh and salt waters, always going, inland,
usually to the head of rivers, during the spawning season. The young
after a time seek salt water, but generally return to fresh water.
Penobscot River Salmon are the best, and come from Maine and St. John,
New Brunswick. The average weight of salmon is from fifteen to
twenty-five pounds, and the flesh is of pinkish orange color. Salmon are
in season from May to September, but frozen salmon may be obtained the
greater part of the year. In the Columbia River and its tributaries
salmon are so abundant that extensive canneries are built along the
banks.

\textbf{Shad}, like salmon, are found in both salt and fresh water, always
ascending rivers for spawning. Shad is caught on the Atlantic Coast of
the United States, and its capture constitutes one of the most important
fisheries. Shad have a silvery hue, which becomes bluish on the back;
they vary in length from eighteen to twenty-eight inches, and are always
sold by the piece, price being irrespective of size. \textit{Jack shad} are
usually cheaper than \textit{roe shad}. The roe of shad is highly esteemed.
Shad are in season from January to June. First shad in market come from
Florida, and retail from one and one-half to two dollars each. The
finest come from New Brunswick, and appear in market about the first of
May.

\textit{Caviare} is the salted roe of the sturgeon.

\textbf{Herring} are usually smoked, or smoked and salted, and, being very
cheap, are a most economical food.

\section*{Shellfish}


\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{I. Bivalve Mollusks}

\textbf{Oysters} are mollusks, having two shells. The shells are on the right
and left side of the oyster, and are called right and left valves. The
one upon which the oyster rests grows faster, becomes deeper, and is
known as the left valve. The valves are fastened by a ligament, which,
on account of its elasticity, admits of opening and closing of the
shells. The oyster contains a tough muscle, by which it is attached to
the shell; the body is made up largely of the liver (which contains
\textit{glycogen}, animal starch), and is partially surrounded by fluted
layers, which are the gills. Natural oyster beds (or banks) are found in
shallow salt water having stony bottom, along the entire Atlantic Coast.
The oyster industry of the world is chiefly in the United States and
France, and on account of its increase many artificial beds have been
prepared for oyster culture. Oysters are five years old before suitable
for eating. Blue Points, which are small, plump oysters, take their name
from Blue Point, Long Island, from which place they originally came.
Their popularity grew so rapidly that the supply became inadequate for
the demand, and any small, plump oysters were soon sold for Blue Points.
During the oyster season they form the first course of a dinner, served
raw on the half shell. In our markets, selected oysters (which are
extremely large and used for broiling) Providence River, and Norfolk
oysters are familiarly known, and, taken out of the shells, are sold by
the quart. Farther south, they are sold by count.

Oysters are obtainable all the year, but are in season from September to
May. During the summer mouths they are flabby and of poor flavor,
although when fresh they are perfectly wholesome. \textit{Mussels}, eaten in
England and other parts of Europe, are similar to oysters, though of
inferior quality. Oysters are nutritious and of easy digestibility,
especially when eaten raw.

\textit{To Open Oysters.} Put a thin flat knife under the back end of the right
valve, and push forward until it cuts the strong muscle which holds the
shells together. As soon as this is done, the right valve may be raised
and separated from the left.

\textit{To Clean Oysters.} Put oysters in a strainer placed over a bowl. Pour
over oysters cold water, allowing one-half cup water to each quart
oysters. Carefully pick over oysters, taking each one separately in the
fingers, to remove any particles of shell which adhere to tough muscle.

\textbf{Clams}, among bivalve mollusks, rank in value next to oysters. They are
found just below the surface of sand and mud, above low-water mark, and
are easily dug with shovel or rake. Clams have hard or soft shells.
Soft-shell clams are dear to the New Englander. From New York to Florida
are found hard-shelled clams (quahaugs). \textit{Small quahaugs} are called
\textit{Little Neck Clams} and take the place of Blue Points at dinner, when
Blue Points are out of season.

\textbf{Scallops} are bivalve mollusks, the best being found in Long Island
Sound and Narragansett Bay. The central muscle forms the edible portion,
and is the only part sent to market. Scallops are in season from October
first to April first.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{II. Crustaceans}

\textbf{Lobsters} belong to the highest order of Crustaceans, live exclusively
in sea-water, generally near rocky coasts, and are caught in pots set on
gravelly bottoms. The largest and best species are found in Atlantic
waters from Maine to New Jersey, being most abundant on Maine and
Massachusetts coasts. Lobsters have been found weighing from sixteen to
twenty-five pounds, but such have been exterminated from our coast. The
average weight is two pounds, and the length from ten to fifteen inches.
Lobsters are largest and most abundant from June to September, but are
obtainable all the year. When taken from the water, shells are of
mottled dark green color, except when found on sandy bottoms, when they
are quite red. Lobsters are generally boiled, causing the shell to turn
red.

A lobster consists of body, tail, two large claws, and four pairs of
small claws. On lower side of body, in front of large claws, are various
small organs which surround the mouth, and a long and short pair of
feelers. Under the tail are found several pairs of appendages. In the
female lobster, also called hen lobster, is found, during the breeding
season, the spawn, known as \textit{coral}. Sex is determined by the pair of
appendages in the tail which lie nearest the body; in the female they
are soft and pliable, in the male hard and stiff. At one time small
lobsters were taken in such quantities that it was feared, if the
practice was long continued, they would be exterminated. To protect the
continuance of lobster fisheries, a law has been passed in many States
prohibiting their sale unless at least ten inches long.

Lobsters shed their shells at irregular intervals, when old ones are
outgrown. The new ones begin to form and take on distinctive
characteristics before the old ones are discarded. New shells after
twenty-four hours' exposure to the water are quite hard.

Lobsters, being coarse feeders (taking almost any animal substance
attainable), are difficult of digestion, and with some create great
gastric disturbance; notwithstanding, they are seldom found diseased.

\textit{To Select a Lobster.} Take in the hand, and if heavy in proportion to
its size, the lobster is fresh. Straighten the tail, and if it springs
into place the lobster was alive (as it should have been) when put into
the pot for boiling. There is greater shrinkage in lobsters than in any
other fish.

\textit{To Open Lobsters.} Take off large claws, small claws, and separate tail
from body. Tail meat may sometimes be drawn out whole with a fork; more
often it is necessary to cut the thin shell portion (using scissors or a
can opener) in under part of the tail, then the tail meat may always be
removed whole. Separate tail meat through centre, and remove the small
intestinal vein which runs its entire length; although generally darker
than the meat, it is sometimes found of the same color. Hold body shell
firmly in left hand, and with first two fingers and thumb of right hand
draw out the body, leaving in shell the stomach (known as the \textit{lady}),
which is not edible, and also some of the green part, the \textit{liver}. The
liver may be removed by shaking the shell. The sides of the body are
covered with the \textit{lungs}; these are always discarded. Break body through
the middle and separate body bones, picking out meat that lies between
them, which is some of the sweetest and tenderest to be found. Separate
large claws at joints. If shells are thin, with a knife cut off a strip
down the sharp edge, so that shell may be broken apart and meat removed
whole. Where shell is thick, it must be broken with a mallet or hammer.
Small claws are used for garnishing. The shell of body, tail, and lower
part of large claws, if not broken, may be washed, dried, and used for
serving of lobster meat after it has been prepared. The portions of
lobsters which are not edible are \textit{lungs}, \textit{stomach} (lady), and
\textit{intestinal vein}.

\textbf{Crabs} among Crustaceans are next in importance to lobsters,
commercially speaking. They are about two and one-half inches long by
five inches wide, and are found along the Atlantic Coast from
Massachusetts to Florida, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Crabs, like
lobsters, change their shells. \textit{Soft-shell} crabs are those which have
recently shed their old shells, and the new shells have not had time to
harden; these are considered by many a great luxury. \textit{Oyster crabs}
(very small crabs found in shells with oysters) are a delicacy not often
indulged in. Crabs are in season during the spring and summer.

\textbf{Shrimps} are found largely in our Southern waters, the largest and best
coming from Lake Pontchartrain. They are about two inches long, covered
with a thin shell, and are boiled and sent to market with heads removed.
Their grayish color is changed to pink by boiling. Shrimps are in season
from May first to October first, and are generally used for salads.
Canned shrimps are much used and favorably known.

\textit{Reptiles.} Frogs and terrapin belong to a lower order of animals than
fish,--reptiles. They are both table delicacies, and are eaten by the
few.

Only the hind legs of frogs are eaten, and have much the same flavor as
chicken.

Terrapin, although sold in our large cities, specially belong to
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, where they are cooked and
served at their best. They are shipped from the South, packed in
seaweed, and may be kept for some time in a dark place. Terrapin are
found in both fresh and salt-water. The Diamond Back, salt-water
terrapin, coming from Chesapeake Bay, are considered the best, and
command a very high price. Terrapin closely resembling Diamond Back,
coming from Texas and Florida, are principally sold in our markets.
Terrapin are in season from November to April, but are best in January,
February, and March. They should always be cooked alive.

\section*{To Prepare Fish For Cooking}

\textbf{To Clean a Fish.} Fish are cleaned and dressed at market as ordered,
but need additional cleaning before cooking. Remove scales which have
not been taken off. This is done by drawing a knife over fish, beginning
at tail and working towards head, occasionally wiping knife and scales
from fish. Incline knife slightly towards you to prevent scales from
flying. The largest number of scales will be found on the flank. Wipe
thoroughly inside and out with cloth wrung out of cold water, removing
any clotted blood which may be found adhering to backbone.

Head and tail may or may not be removed, according to size of fish and
manner of cooking. Small fish are generally served with head and tail
left on.

\textbf{To Skin a Fish.} With sharp knife remove fins along the back and cut
off a narrow strip of skin the entire length of back. Loosen skin on one
side from bony part of gills, and being once started, if fish is fresh,
it may be readily drawn off; if flesh is soft do not work too quickly,
as it will be badly torn. By allowing knife to closely follow skin this
may be avoided. After removing skin from one side, turn fish and skin
the other side.

\textbf{To Bone a Fish.} Clean and skin before boning. Beginning at the tail,
run a sharp knife under flesh close to backbone, and with knife follow
bone (making as clean a cut as possible) its entire length, thus
accomplishing the removal of one-half the flesh; turn, and remove flesh
from other side. Pick out with fingers any small bones that may remain.
Cod, haddock, halibut, and whitefish are easily and frequently boned;
flounders and smelts occasionally.

\textbf{To Fillet Fish.} Clean, skin, and bone. A piece of fish, large or
small, freed from skin and bones, is known as a fillet. Halibut, cut in
three-fourths inch slices, is more often cut in fillets than any kind of
fish, and fillets are frequently rolled. When flounder is cut in fillets
it is served under the name of \textit{fillet of sole}. Sole found in English
waters is much esteemed, and flounder is our nearest approach to it.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Ways Of Cooking Fish}

\textit{To Cook Fish in Boiling Water.} Small cod, haddock, or cusk are cooked
whole in enough boiling water to cover, to which is added salt and lemon
juice or vinegar. Salt gives flavor; lemon juice or vinegar keeps the
flesh white. A long fish-kettle containing a rack on which to place fish
is useful but rather expensive. In place of fish-kettle, if the fish is
not too large to be coiled in it, a frying-basket may be used placed in
any kettle.

Large fish are cut in thick pieces for boiling, containing the number of
pounds required. Examples: salmon and halibut.

Pieces cut from large fish for boiling should be cleaned and tied in a
piece of cheese-cloth to prevent scum being deposited on the fish. If
skin is not removed before serving, scald the dark skin and scrape to
remove coloring; this may be easily accomplished by holding fish on two
forks, and lowering into boiling water the part covered with black skin;
then remove and scrape. Time required for boiling fish depends on extent
of surface exposed to water. Consult Time Table for Boiling, which will
serve as a guide. The fish is cooked when flesh leaves the bone, no
matter how long the time.





\textbf{To Broil Fish.} Cod, haddock, bluefish, and mackerel are split down the
back and broiled whole, removing head and tail or not, as desired.
Salmon, chicken halibut, and swordfish are cut in inch slices for
broiling. Smelts and other small fish are broiled whole, without
splitting. Clean and wipe fish as dry as possible, sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and place in well-greased wire broiler. Slices of fish
should be turned often while broiling; whole fish should be first
broiled on flesh side, then turned and broiled on skin side just long
enough to make skin brown and crisp.

To remove from broiler, loosen fish on one side, turn and loosen on
other side; otherwise flesh will cling to broiler. Slip from broiler to
hot platter, or place platter over fish and invert platter and broiler
together.

\textbf{To Bake Fish.} Clean, and bake on a greased fish-sheet placed in a
dripping-pan. If a fish-sheet is not at hand, place strips of cotton
cloth under fish, by which it may be lifted from pan.

\textbf{To Fry Fish.} Clean fish, and wipe as dry as possible. Sprinkle with
salt, dip in flour or crumbs, egg, and crumbs, and fry in deep fat.

\textbf{To Sauté Fish.} Prepare as for frying, and cook in frying-pan with
small amount of fat; or, if preferred, dip in granulated corn meal. Cod
steak and smelts are often cooked in this way.

\chapter{Beef}



Meat is the name applied to the flesh of all animals used for food. Beef
is the meat of steer, ox, or cow, and is the most nutritious and largely
consumed of all animal foods. Meat is chiefly composed of the
albuminoids (fibrin, albumen, gelatin), fat, mineral matter, and water.

\textbf{Fibrin} is that substance in blood which causes it to coagulate when
shed. It consists of innumerable delicate fibrils which entangle the
blood corpuscles, and form with them a mass called blood clot. Fibrin is
insoluble in both cold and hot water.

\textbf{Albumen} is a substance found in the blood and muscle. It is soluble in
cold water, and is coagulated by hot water or heat. It begins to
coagulate at 134deg F. and becomes solid at 160deg F. Here lies the
necessity of cooking meat in hot water at a low temperature; of broiling
meat at a high temperature, to quickly sear surface.

\textbf{Gelatin} in its raw state is termed \textit{collagen}. It is a transparent,
tasteless substance, obtained by boiling with water, muscle, skin,
cartilage, bone, tendon, ligament, or membrane of animals. By this
process, collagen of connective tissues is dissolved and converted into
gelatin. Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, soluble in hot water, but
in boiling water is decomposed, and by much boiling will not solidify on
cooling. When subjected to cold water it swells, and is called hydrated
gelatin. Myosin is the albuminoid of muscle, collagen of tendons, ossein
of bones, and chondrin of cartilage and gristle.

Gelatin, although highly nitrogenous, does not act in the system as
other nitrogenous foods, as a large quantity passes out unchanged.

\textbf{Fat} is the white or yellowish oily solid substance forming the chief
part of the adipose tissue. Fat is found in thick layers directly under
the skin, in other parts of the body, in bone, and is intermingled
throughout the flesh. Fat as food is a great heat-giver and
force-producer. \textit{Suet} is the name given to fat which lies about the
loins and kidneys. Beef suet tried out and clarified is much used in
cookery for shortening and frying.

\textbf{Mineral Matter.} The largest amount of mineral matter is found in bone.
It is principally calcium phosphate (phosphate of lime). Sodium chloride
(common salt) is found in the blood and throughout the tissues.

\textbf{Water} abounds in all animals, constituting a large percentage of their
weight.

The color of meat is due to the coloring matter (hæmoglobin) which
abounds in the red corpuscles of the blood.

The distinctive flavor of meat is principally due to peptones and allied
substances, and is intensified by the presence of sodium chloride and
other salts.

The beef creature is divided by splitting through the backbone in two
parts, each part being called \textit{a side of beef}. Four hundred and fifty
pounds is good market weight for a side of beef.

The most expensive cuts come from that part of the creature where
muscles are but little used, which makes the meat finer-grained and
consequently more tender, taking less time for cooking. Many of the
cheapest cuts, though equally nutritious, need long, slow cooking to
render them tender enough to digest easily. Tough meat which has long
and coarse fibres is often found to be very juicy, on account of the
greater motion of that part of the creature, which causes the juices to
flow freely. Roasting and broiling, which develop so fine a flavor, can
only be applied to the more expensive cuts. The liver, kidneys, and
heart are of firm, close texture, and difficult of digestion. Tripe,
which is the first stomach of the ox, is easy of digestion, but on
account of the large amount of fat which it contains, it is undesirable
for those of weak digestion.

The quality of beef depends on age of the creature and manner of
feeding. The best beef is obtained from a steer of four or five years.
Good beef should be firm and of fine-grained texture, bright red in
color, and well mottled and coated with fat. The fat should be firm and
of a yellowish color. Suet should be dry, and crumble easily. Beef
should not be eaten as soon as killed, but allowed to hang and
ripen,--from two to three weeks in winter, and two weeks in summer.

Meat should be removed from paper as soon as it comes from market,
otherwise paper absorbs some of the juices.

Meat should be kept in a cool place. In winter, beef may be bought in
large quantities and cut as needed. If one chooses, a loin or rump may
be bought and kept by the butcher, who sends cuts as ordered.

Always wipe beef, before cooking, with a cheese-cloth wrung out of cold
water, but never allow it to stand in a pan of cold water, as juices
will be drawn out.

\section*{The Effect Of Different Temperatures On The Cooking Of Meat}

By putting meat in cold water and allowing water to heat gradually, a
large amount of juice is extracted and meat is tasteless; and by long
cooking the connective tissues are softened and dissolved, which gives
to the stock when cold a jelly-like consistency. This principle applies
to soup making.

By putting meat in boiling water, allowing the water to boil for a few
minutes, then lowering the temperature, juices in the outer surface are
quickly coagulated, and the inner juices are prevented from escaping.
This principle applies where nutriment and flavor is desired in meat.
Examples: boiled mutton, fowl.

By putting in cold water, bringing quickly to the boiling-point, then
lowering the temperature and cooking slowly until meat is tender, some
of the goodness will be in the stock, but a large portion left in the
meat. Examples: fowl, when cooked to use for made-over dishes, Scotch
Broth.

\section*{Broiled Beefsteak}

The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, cross-cut
of rump steaks, and second and third cuts from top of round. Porterhouse
and sirloin cuts are the most expensive, on account of the great loss in
bone and fat, although price per pound is about the same as for
cross-cut of rump. Round steak is very juicy, but, having coarser fibre,
is not as tender. Steaks should be cut at least an inch thick, and from
that to two and one-half inches. The flank end of sirloin steak should
be removed before cooking. It may be put in soup kettle, or lean part
may be chopped and utilized for meat cakes, fat tried out and clarified
for shortening.

\textbf{To Broil Steak.} Wipe with a cloth wrung out of cold water, and trim
off superfluous fat. With some of the fat grease a wire broiler, place
meat in broiler (having fat edge next to handle), and broil over a clear
fire, turning every ten seconds for the first minute, that surface may
be well seared, thus preventing escape of juices. After the first
minute, turn occasionally until well cooked on both sides. Steak cut one
inch thick will take five minutes, if liked rare; six minutes, if well
done. Remove to hot platter, spread with butter, and sprinkle with salt
and pepper.

\section*{Roast Beef}

The best cuts of beef for roasting are: tip or middle of sirloin, back
of rump, or first three ribs. Tip of sirloin roast is desirable for a
small family. Back of rump makes a superior roast for a large family,
and is more economical than sirloin. It is especially desirable where a
large quantity of dish gravy is liked, for in carving the meat juices
follow the knife. Rib roasts contain more fat than either of the others,
and are somewhat cheaper.

\textbf{To Roast Beef.} Wipe, put on a rack in dripping-pan, skin side down,
rub over with salt, and dredge meat and pan with flour. Place in hot
oven, that the surface may be quickly seared, thus preventing escape of
inner juices. After flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and baste with
fat which has tried out; if meat is quite lean, it may be necessary to
put trimmings of fat in pan. Baste every ten minutes; if this rule is
followed, meat will be found more juicy. When meat is about half done,
turn it over and dredge with flour, that skin side may be uppermost for
final browning. For roasting, consult Time Table for Baking Meats, page
30.

If there is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small quantity of
water; this, however, is not desirable, and seldom need be done if size
of pan is adapted to size of roast. Beef to be well roasted should be
started in hot oven and heat decreased, so that when carved the slices
will be red throughout, with a crisp layer of golden brown fat on the
top. Beef roasted when temperature is so high that surface is hardened
before heat can penetrate to the centre is most unsatisfactory.

Sirloin or rib roasts may have the bones removed, and be rolled,
skewered, and tied in shape. Chicago Butt is cut from the most tender
part of back of rump. They are shipped from Chicago, our greatest beef
centre, and if fresh and from a heavy creature, make excellent roasts at
a small price.

\textbf{Roast Beef Gravy.} Remove some of the fat from pan, leaving four
tablespoons. Place on front of range, add four tablespoons flour, and
stir until well browned. The flour, dredged and browned in pan, should
give additional color to gravy. Add gradually one and one-half cups
boiling water, cook five minutes, season with salt and pepper, and
strain. If flour should burn in pan, gravy will be full of black
particles.

\textbf{To Carve a Roast of Beef.} Have roast placed on platter skin side up;
with a pointed, thin-bladed, sharp knife cut a sirloin or rib roast in
thin slices at right angles to the ribs, and cut slices from ribs. If
there is tenderloin, remove it from under the bone, and cut in thin
slices across grain of meat. Carve back of rump in thin slices with the
grain of meat; by so doing, some of the least tender muscle will be
served with that which is tender. By cutting across grain of meat, the
tenderest portion is sliced by itself, as is the less tender portion.

\section*{Larded Fillet Of Beef}

The tenderloin of beef which lies under the loin and rump is called
fillet of beef. The fillet under the loin is known as the long fillet,
and when removed no porterhouse steaks can be cut; therefore it commands
a higher price than the short fillet lying under rump. Two short fillets
are often skewered together, and served in place of a long fillet.

Wipe, remove fat, veins, and any tendinous portions; skewer in shape,
and lard upper side with grain of meat, following directions for larding
on page 23. Place on a rack in small pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper,
dredge with flour, and put in bottom of pan small pieces of pork. Bake
twenty to thirty minutes in hot oven, basting three times. Take out
skewer, remove meat to hot platter, and garnish with watercress. Serve

Fry out pork and remove scraps. Wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and
pepper, dredge with flour, and brown entire surface in pork fat. When
turning meat, avoid piercing with fork or skewer, which allows the inner
juices to escape. Place on trivet in deep granite pan or in earthen
pudding-dish, and surround with vegetables, peppercorns, and three cups
boiling water; cover closely, and bake four hours in very slow oven,
basting every half-hour, and turning after second hour. Throughout the
cooking, the liquid should be kept below the boiling-point. Serve with
Horseradish Sauce, or with sauce made from liquor in pan.

\section*{Beef À La Mode}

Insert twelve large lardoons in a four-pound piece of beef cut from the
round. Make incisions for lardoons by running through the meat a large
skewer. Season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and brown the
entire surface in pork fat. Put on a trivet in kettle, surround with
one-third cup each carrot, turnip, celery, and onion cut in dice, sprig
of parsley, bit of bay leaf, and water to half cover meat. Cover
closely, and cook slowly four hours, keeping liquor below the
boiling-point. Remove to hot platter. Strain liquor, thicken and season
to serve as a gravy. When beef is similarly prepared (with exception of
lardoons and vegetables), and cooked in smaller amount of water, it is
called Smothered Beef, or Pot Roast. A bean-pot (covered with a piece of
buttered paper, tied firmly down) is the best utensil to use for a Pot
Roast.

sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour. Cut some of the
fat in small pieces and try out in frying-pan. Add meat and stir
constantly, that the surface may be quickly seared; when well browned,
put in kettle, and rinse frying-pan with boiling water, that none of the
goodness may be lost. Add to meat remaining fat, and bone sawed in
pieces; cover with boiling water and boil five minutes, then cook at a
lower temperature until meat is tender (time required being about three
hours). Add carrot, turnip, and onion, with salt and pepper the last
hour of cooking. Parboil potatoes five minutes, and add to stew fifteen
minutes before taking from fire. Remove bones, large pieces of fat, and
then skim. Thicken with one-fourth cup flour, diluted with enough cold
water to pour easily. Pour in deep hot platter, and surround with
dumplings. Remnants of roast beef are usually made into a beef stew; the
meat having been once cooked, there is no necessity of browning it. If
gravy is left, it should be added to the stew.

steam twelve minutes. A perforated tin pie plate may be used in place of
steamer. A little more milk may be used in the mixture, when it may be
taken up by spoonfuls, dropped and cooked on top of stew. In this case
some of the liquid must be removed, that dumplings may rest on meat and
potato, and not settle into liquid.

\section*{Corned Beef}

Corned beef has but little nutritive value. It is used to give variety
to our diet in summer, when fresh meats prove too stimulating. It is
eaten by the workingman to give bulk to his food. The best pieces of
corned beef are the rattle rand and fancy brisket. The fancy brisket
commands a higher price and may be easily told from the rattle rand by
the selvage on lower side and the absence of bones. The upper end of
brisket (butt end) is thick and composed mostly of lean meat, the middle
cut has more fat but is not well mixed, while the lower (navel end) has
a large quantity of fat. The rattle rand contains a thick lean end; the
second cut contains three distinct layers of meat and fat, and is
considered the best cut by those who prefer meat well streaked with fat.
The rattle rand has a thin end, which contains but one layer of lean
meat and much fat, consequently is not a desirable piece.

\textbf{To Boil Corned Beef.} Wipe the meat and tie securely in shape, if this
has not been already done at market. Put in kettle, cover with cold
water, and bring slowly to boiling-point. Boil five minutes, remove
scum, and cook at a lower temperature until tender. Cool slightly in
water in which it was cooked, remove to a dish, cover, and place on
cover a weight, that meat may be well pressed. The lean meat and fat may
be separated and put in alternate layers in a bread pan, then covered
and pressed.

\section*{Boiled Dinner}

A boiled dinner consists of warm impressed corned beef, served with
cabbage, beets, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. After removing meat from
water, skim off fat and cook vegetables (with exception of beets, which
require a long time for cooking) in this water. Carrots require a longer
time for cooking than cabbage or turnips. Carrots and turnips, if small,
may be cooked whole; if large, cut in pieces. Cabbage and beets are
served in separate dishes, other vegetables on same dish with meat.

\chapter{Lamb And Mutton}



Lamb is the name given to the meat of lambs; mutton, to the meat of
sheep. Lamb, coming as it does from the young creature, is immature, and
less nutritious than mutton. The flesh of mutton ranks with the flesh of
beef in nutritive value and digestibility. The fat of mutton, on account
of its larger percentage of stearic acid, is more difficult of digestion
than the fat of beef.

Lamb may be eaten soon after the animal is killed and dressed; mutton
must hang to ripen. Good mutton comes from a sheep about three years
old, and should hang from two to three weeks. The English South Down
Mutton is cut from creatures even older than three years. Young lamb,
when killed from six weeks to three months old, is called spring lamb,
and appears in the market as early as the last of January, but is very
scarce until March. Lamb one year old is called a yearling. Many object
to the strong flavor of mutton; this is greatly overcome by removing the
pink skin and trimming off superfluous fat.

Lamb and mutton are divided into two parts by cutting through entire
length of backbone; then subdivided into fore and hind quarter, eight
ribs being left on hind quarter,--while in beef but three ribs are left
on hind-quarter. These eight ribs are cut into chops and are known as
\textit{rib chops}. The meat which lies between these ribs and the leg, cut
into chops, is known as \textit{loin} or \textit{kidney chops}.

Lamb and mutton chops cut from loin have a small piece of tenderloin on
one side of bone, and correspond to porterhouse steaks in the beef
creature. Rib chops which have the bone cut short and scraped clean,
nearly to the lean meat, are called \textit{French chops}.

\textit{The leg} is sold whole for boiling or roasting. The fore-quarter may be
boned, stuffed, rolled, and roasted, but is more often used for broth,
stew, or fricassee.

For \textit{a saddle of mutton} the loin is removed whole before splitting the
creature. Some of the bones are removed and the flank ends are rolled,
fastened with wooden skewers, and securely tied to keep skewers in
place.

Good quality mutton should be fine-grained and of bright pink color; the
fat white, hard, and flaky. If the outside skin comes off easily, mutton
is sure to be good. Lamb chops may be easily distinguished from mutton
chops by the red color of bone. As lamb grows older, blood recedes from
bones; therefore in mutton the bone is white. In \textit{leg of lamb} the bone
at joint is serrated, while in leg of mutton the bone at joint is smooth
and rounded. Good mutton contains a larger proportion of fat than good
beef. Poor mutton is often told by the relatively small proportion of
fat and lean as compared to bone.

Lamb is usually preferred well done; mutton is often cooked rare.

\chapter{Veal}



Veal is the meat obtained from a young calf killed when six to eight
weeks old. Veal from a younger animal is very unwholesome, and is liable
to provoke serious gastric disturbances. Veal contains a much smaller
percentage of fat than beef or mutton, is less nutritious, and (though
from a young creature) more difficult of digestion. Like lamb, it is not
improved by long hanging, but should be eaten soon after killing and
dressing. It should always be remembered that the flesh of young animals
does not keep fresh as long as that of older ones. Veal is divided in
same manner as lamb, into fore and hind quarters. The fore-quarter is
subdivided into breast, shoulder, and neck; the hind-quarter into loin,
leg, and knuckle. Cutlets, fillets (cushion), and fricandeau are cut
from the thick part of leg.

Good veal may be known by its pinkish-colored flesh and white fat; when
the flesh lacks color, it has been taken from a creature which was too
young to kill for food, or, if of the right age, was bled before
killing. Veal may be obtained throughout the year, but is in season
during the spring. Veal should be thoroughly cooked; being deficient in
fat and having but little flavor, pork or butter should be added while
cooking, and more seasoning is required than for other meats.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Veal Cutlets}

Use slices of veal from leg cut one-half inch thick. Wipe, remove bone
and skin, then cut in pieces for serving. The long, irregular-shaped

well browned, in salt pork fat or butter; then remove cutlets to stewpan
and pour over one and one-half cups Brown Sauce. Place on back of range
and cook slowly forty minutes, or until cutlets are tender.

Veal may be cooked first in boiling water until tender, then crumbed and
fried. The water in which veal was cooked may be used for sauce. Arrange
on hot platter, strain sauce and pour around cutlets, and garnish with
parsley.

\textbf{Brown Sauce.} Brown three tablespoons butter, add three tablespoons
flour, and stir until well browned. Add gradually one and one-half cups
stock or water, or half stock and half stewed and strained tomatoes.
Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and Worcestershire Sauce. The
trimmings from veal (including skin and bones) may be covered with one
and one-half cups cold water, allowed to heat slowly to boiling-point,
then cooked, strained, and used for sauce.

\chapter{Sweetbreads}



A sweetbread is the thymus gland of lamb or calf, but in cookery, veal
sweetbreads only are considered. It is prenatally developed, of unknown
function, and as soon as calf is taken from liquid food it gradually
disappears. Pancreas, stomach sweetbread, is sold in some sections of
the country, but in our markets this custom is not practised.
Sweetbreads are a reputed table delicacy, and a valuable addition to the
menu of the convalescent.

A sweetbread consists of two parts, connected by tubing and membranes.
The round, compact part is called the heart sweetbread, as its position
is nearer the heart; the other part is called the throat sweetbread.
When sweetbread is found in market separated, avoid buying two of the
throat sweetbreads, as the heart sweetbread is more desirable.

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly. They should be removed from paper as
soon as received from market, plunged into cold water and allowed to
stand one hour, drained, and put into acidulated salted boiling water
then allowed to cook slowly twenty minutes; again drained, and plunged
into cold water, that they may be kept white and firm. Sweetbreads are
always parboiled in this manner for subsequent cooking.

\chapter{Pork}



Pork is the flesh and fat of pig or hog. Different parts of the
creature, when dressed, take different names.

The chine and spareribs, which correspond to the loin in lamb and veal,
are used for roasts or steaks. Two ribs are left on the chine. The hind
legs furnish \textit{hams}. These are cured, salted, and smoked. Sugar-cured
hams are considered the best. Pickle, to which is added light brown
sugar, molasses, and saltpetre, is introduced close to bone; hams are
allowed to hang one week, then smoked with hickory wood. \textit{Shoulders} are
usually corned, or salted and smoked, though sometimes cooked fresh.
\textit{Pigs' feet} are boiled until tender, split, and covered with vinegar
made from white wine. \textit{Hocks}, the part just above the feet, are corned,
and much used by Germans. \textit{Heads} are soused, and cooked by boiling. The
flank, which lies just below the ribs, is salted and smoked, and
furnishes \textit{bacon}. The best pieces of fat salt pork come from the back,
on either side of backbone.

Fat, when separated from flesh and membrane, is tried out and called
lard. \textit{Leaf lard} is the best, and is tried out from the leaf shaped
pieces of solid fat which lie inside the flank. \textit{Sausages} are trimmings
of lean and fat meat, minced, highly seasoned, and forced into thin
casings made of the prepared entrails. \textit{Little pigs} (four weeks old)
are sometimes killed; dressed, and roasted whole.

Pork contains the largest percentage of fat of any meat. When eaten
fresh it is the most difficult of digestion, and although found in
market through the entire year, it should be but seldom served, and then
only during the winter months. By curing, salting, and smoking, pork is
rendered more wholesome. \textit{Bacon}, next to butter and cream, is the most
easily assimilated of all fatty foods.

\section*{Boston Baked Beans}

Pick over one quart pea beans, cover with cold water, and soak over
night. In morning, drain, cover with fresh water, heat slowly (keeping
water below boiling-point), and cook until skins will burst,--which is
best determined by taking a few beans on the tip of a spoon and blowing
on them, when skins will burst if sufficiently cooked. Beans thus tested
must, of course, be thrown away. Drain beans, throwing bean-water out of
doors, not in sink. Scald rind of three-fourths pound fat salt pork,
scrape, remove one-fourth inch slice and put in bottom of bean-pot. Cut
through rind of remaining pork every one-half inch, making cuts one inch
deep. Put beans in pot and bury pork in beans, leaving rind exposed. Mix
one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon molasses, and three tablespoons
sugar; add one cup boiling water, and pour over beans; then add enough
more boiling water to cover beans. Cover bean-pot, put in oven, and bake
slowly six or eight hours, uncovering the last hour of cooking, that
rind may become brown and crisp. Add water as needed. Many feel sure
that by adding with seasonings one-half tablespoon mustard, the beans
are more easily digested. If pork mixed with lean is preferred, use less
salt.

The fine reputation which Boston Baked Beans have gained has been
attributed to the earthen bean-pot with small top and bulging sides in
which they are supposed to be cooked. Equally good beans have often been
eaten where a five-pound lard pail was substituted for the broken
bean-pot.

Yellow-eyed beans are very good when baked.





\chapter{Poultry And Game}



Poultry includes all domestic birds suitable for food except pigeon and
squab. Examples: chicken, fowl, turkey, duck, goose, etc. Game includes
such birds and animals suitable for food as are pursued and taken in
field and forest. Examples: quail, partridge, wild duck, plover, deer,
etc.

The flesh of chicken, fowl, and turkey has much shorter fibre than that
of ruminating animals, and is not intermingled with fat,--the fat always
being found in layers directly under the skin, and surrounding the
intestines. Chicken, fowl, and turkey are nutritious, and chicken is
specially easy of digestion. The white meat found on breast and wing is
more readily digested than the dark meat. The legs, on account of
constant motion, are of a coarser fibre and darker color.

Since incubators have been so much used for hatching chickens, small
birds suitable for broiling may be always found in market. Chickens
which appear in market during January weighing about one and one-half
pounds are called \textit{spring chickens}.

Fowl is found in market throughout the year, but is at its best from
March until June.

Philadelphia, until recently, furnished our market with Philadelphia
chickens and \textit{capons}, but now Massachusetts furnishes equally good
ones, which are found in market from December to June. They are very
large, plump, and superior eating. At an early age they are deprived of
the organs of reproduction, penned, and specially fatted for killing.
They are recognized by the presence of head, tail, and wing feathers.

Turkeys are found in market throughout the year, but are best during the
winter months. Tame ducks and geese are very indigestible on account of
the large quantity of fat they contain. Goose meat is thoroughly
infiltrated with fat, containing sometimes forty to forty-five per cent.
Pigeons, being old birds, need long, slow cooking to make them tender.
Squabs (young pigeons) make a delicious tidbit for the convalescent, and
are often the first meat allowed a patient by the physician.

The flesh of game, with the exception of wild duck and wild geese, is
tender, contains less fat than poultry, is of fine though strong flavor,
and easy of digestion. Game meat is usually of dark color, partridge and
quail being exceptions, and is usually cooked rare. Venison, the flesh
of deer, is short-fibred, dark-colored, highly savored, tender, and easy
of digestion; being highly savored, it often disagrees with those of
weak digestion.

Geese are in market throughout the year; Massachusetts and Rhode Island
furnishing specially good ones. A goose twelve weeks old is known as a
\textit{green goose}. They may be found in market from May to September. Young
geese which appear in market September first and continue through
December are called \textit{goslings}. They have been hatched during May and
June, and then fatted for market.

Young ducks, found in market about March first, are called \textit{ducklings}.
Canvasback Ducks have gained a fine reputation throughout the country,
and are found in market from the last of November until March. Redhead
Ducks are in season two weeks earlier, and are about as good eating as
Canvasback Ducks, and much less in price. The distinctive flavor of both
is due to the wild celery on which they feed. Many other kinds of ducks
are found in market during the fall and winter. Examples: Widgeon,
Mallard, Lake Erie Teal, Black Ducks, and Butterballs.

Fresh quail are in market from October fifteenth to January first, the
law forbidding their being killed at any other time in the year. The
same is true of partridge, but both are frozen and kept in cold storage
several months. California sends frozen quail in large numbers to
Eastern markets. Grouse (\textit{prairie chicken}) are always obtainable,--fresh
ones in the fall; later, those kept in cold storage. Plover may be
bought from April until December.

\textbf{To Select Poultry and Game.} A \textit{chicken} is known by soft feet, smooth
skin, and soft cartilage at end of breastbone. An abundance of
pinfeathers always indicates a young bird, while the presence of long
hairs denotes age. In a \textit{fowl} the feet have become hard and dry with
coarse scales, and cartilage at end of breastbone has ossified. \_Cock
turkeys\_ are usually better eating than hen turkeys, unless hen turkey
is young, small, and plump. A good turkey should be plump, have smooth
dark legs, and cartilage at end of breastbone soft and pliable. Good
geese abound in pinfeathers. Small birds should be plump, have soft feet
and pliable bills.

\textbf{To Dress and Clean Poultry.} Remove hairs and down by holding the bird
over a flame (from gas, alcohol, or burning paper) and constantly
changing position until all parts of surface have been exposed to flame;
this is known as \textit{singeing}. Cut off the head and draw out pinfeathers,
using a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin around the leg one and
one-half inches below the leg joint, care being taken not to cut
tendons; place leg at this cut over edge of board, press downward to
snap the bone, then take foot in right hand, holding bird firmly in left
hand, and pull off foot, and with it the tendons. In old birds the
tendons must be drawn separately, which is best accomplished by using a
steel skewer. Make an incision through skin below breastbone, just large
enough to admit the hand. With the hand remove entrails, gizzard, heart,
and liver; the last three named constitute what is known as \textit{giblets}.
The gall-bladder, lying on the under surface of the right lobe of the
liver, is removed with liver, and great care must be taken that it is
not broken, as a small quantity of the bile which it contains would
impart a bitter flavor to the parts with which it came in contact.
Enclosed by the ribs, on either side of backbone, may be found the
lungs, of spongy consistency and red color. Care must be taken that
every part of them is removed. Kidneys, lying in the hollow near end of
backbone, must also be removed. By introducing first two fingers under
skin close to neck, the windpipe may be easily found and withdrawn; also
the crop, which will be found adhering to skin close to breast. Draw
down neck skin, and cut off neck close to body, leaving skin long enough
to fasten under the back. Remove oil bag, and wash bird by allowing cold
water to run through it, not allowing bird to soak in cold water. Wipe
inside and outside, looking carefully to see that everything has been
withdrawn. If there is disagreeable odor, suggesting that fowl may have
been kept too long, clean at once, wash inside and out with soda water,
and sprinkle inside with charcoal and place some under wings.

Poultry dressed at market seldom have tendons removed unless so ordered.
It is always desirable to have them withdrawn, as they become hard and
bony during cooking. It is the practice of market-men to cut a gash
through the skin, to easier reach crop and windpipe. This gash must be
sewed before stuffing, and causes the bird to look less attractive when
cooked.

\textbf{To Cut up a Fowl.} Singe, draw out pinfeathers, cut off head, remove
tendons and oil bag. Cut through skin between leg and body close to
body, bend back leg (thus breaking ligaments), cut through flesh, and
separate at joint. Separate the upper part of leg, \textit{second joint}, from
lower part of leg, \textit{drumstick}, as leg is separated from body. Remove
wing by cutting through skin and flesh around upper wing joint which
lies next to body, then disjoint from body. Cut off tip of wing and
separate wing at middle joint. Remove leg and wing from other side.
Separate breast from back by cutting through skin, beginning two inches
below breastbone and passing knife between terminus of small ribs on
either side and extending cut to collar-bone. Before removing entrails,
gizzard, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, and windpipe, observe their
position, that the anatomy of the bird may be understood. The back is
sometimes divided by cutting through the middle crosswise. The wishbone,
with adjoining meat, is frequently removed, and the breast meat may be
separated in two parts by cutting through flesh close to breastbone with
cleaver. Wipe pieces, excepting back, with cheese-cloth wrung out of
cold water. Back piece needs thorough washing.

\textbf{To Clean Giblets.} Remove thin membrane, arteries, veins, and clotted
blood around heart. Separate gall-bladder from liver, cutting off any of
liver that may have a greenish tinge. Cut fat and membranes from
gizzard. Make a gash through thickest part of gizzard, and cut as far as
inner lining, being careful not to pierce it. Remove the inner sack and
discard. Wash giblets and cook until tender, with neck and tips of
wings, putting them in cold water and heating water quickly that some of
the flavor may be drawn out into stock, which is to be used for making
gravy.

\textbf{To Stuff Poultry.} Put stuffing by spoonfuls in neck end, using enough
to sufficiently fill the skin, that bird may look plump when served.
Where cracker stuffing is used, allowance must be made for the swelling
of crackers, otherwise skin may burst during cooking. Put remaining
stuffing in body; if the body is full, sew skin; if not full, bring skin
together with a skewer.

\textbf{To Truss Fowl.} Draw thighs close to body and hold by inserting a steel
skewer under middle joint running it through body, coming out under
middle joint on other side. Cut piece three-fourths inch wide from neck
skin, and with it fasten legs together at ends; or cross drumsticks, tie
securely with a long string, and fasten to tail. Place wings close to
body and hold them by inserting a second skewer through wing, body, and
wing on opposite side. Draw neck skin under back and fasten with a small
wooden skewer. Turn bird on its breast. Cross string attached to tail
piece and draw it around each end of lower skewer; again cross string
and draw around each end of upper skewer; fasten string in a knot and
cut off ends. In birds that are not stuffed legs are often passed
through incisions cut in body under bones near tail.

\textbf{To Dress Birds for Broiling.} Singe, wipe, and with a sharp-pointed
knife, beginning at back of neck, make a cut through backbone the entire
length of bird. Lay open the bird and remove contents from inside. Cut
out rib bones on either side of backbone, remove from breastbone, then
cut through tendons at joints.

\textbf{To Fillet a Chicken.} Remove skin from breast, and with a small sharp
knife begin at end of collar-bone and cut through flesh, following close
to wish and breast bones the entire length of meat. Raise flesh with
fingers, and with knife free the piece of meat from bones which lie
under it. Cut meat away from wing joint; this solid piece of breast is
meat known as a \textit{fillet}. This meat is easily separated in two parts.
The upper, larger part is called the \textit{large fillet}; the lower part the
\textit{mignon fillet}. The tough skin on the outside of large fillet should be
removed, also the sinew from mignon fillet. To remove tough skin, place
large fillet on a board, upper side down, make an incision through flesh
at top of fillet, and cut entire length of fillet, holding knife as
close to skin as possible. Trim edges, that fillet may look shapely.

\section*{Broiled Chicken}

Dress for broiling, following directions on page 244. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and place in a well-greased broiler. Broil twenty minutes
over a clear fire, watching carefully and turning broiler so that all
parts may be equally browned. The flesh side must be exposed to the fire
the greater part of time, as the skin side will brown quickly. Remove to
a hot platter, spread with soft butter, and sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Chickens are so apt to burn while broiling that many prefer to
partially cook in oven. Place chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot over with butter, and bake fifteen
minutes in hot oven; then broil to finish cooking. \textit{Guinea chickens} are

with three tablespoons butter, rubbed until creamy and mixed with two
tablespoons flour. Dredge bottom of pan with flour. Place in a hot oven,
and when flour is well browned, reduce the heat, then baste. Continue
basting every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For basting, use
one-fourth cup butter, melted in two-thirds cup boiling water, and after
this is gone, use fat in pan, and when necessary to prevent flour
burning, add one cup boiling water. During cooking, turn chicken
frequently, that it may brown evenly. If a thick crust is desired,
dredge bird with flour two or three times during cooking. If a glazed
surface is preferred, spread bird with butter, omitting flour, and do
not dredge during baking. When breast meat is tender, bird is
sufficiently cooked. A four-pound chicken requires about one and
one-half hours.

\chapter{Fish And Meat Sauces}



The French chef keeps always on hand four sauces,--White, Brown,
Béchamel, and Tomato,--and with these as a basis is able to make kinds
innumerable. Butter and flour are usually cooked together for thickening
sauces. When not browned, it is called \textit{roux}; when browned, \_brown
roux\_. The French mix butter and flour together, put in saucepan, place
over fire, stir for five minutes; set aside to cool, again place over
fire, and add liquid, stirring constantly until thick and smooth. Butter
and flour for brown sauces are cooked together much longer, and watched
carefully lest butter should burn. The American cook makes sauce by
stirring butter in saucepan until melted and bubbling, adds flour and
continues stirring, then adds liquid, gradually stirring or beating
until the boiling-point is reached. For Brown Sauce, butter should be
stirred until well browned; flour should be added and stirred with
butter until both are browned before the addition of liquid. The secret
in making a Brown Sauce is to have butter and flour well browned before
adding liquid.

It is well worth remembering that a sauce of average thickness is made
by allowing two tablespoons each of butter and flour to one cup liquid,
whether it be milk, stock, or tomato. For Brown Sauce a slightly larger
quantity of flour is necessary, as by browning flour its thickening
property is lessened, its starch being changed to dextrine. When sauces
are set away, put a few bits of butter on top to prevent crust from
forming.

                                               \textit{W. O. Atwater, Ph.D.}

Vegetables include, commonly though not botanically speaking, all plants
used for food except grains and fruits. With exception of beans, peas,
and lentils, which contain a large amount of protein, they are chiefly
valuable for their potash salts, and should form a part of each day's
dietary. Many contain much cellulose, which gives needed bulk to the
food. The legumes, peas, beans, and lentils may be used in place of
flesh food.

For the various vegetables different parts of the plant are used. Some
are eaten in the natural state, others are cooked.


\arrayrulecolor{tablerowgray}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{3.5in}|}
\hline
Tubers & White potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes \\
\hline
Roots & Beets, carrots, parsnips, radishes, sweet potatoes, salsify or oyster plant, and turnips \\
\hline
Bulbs & Garlic, onions, and shallots \\
\hline
Stems & Asparagus, celery, and chives \\
\hline
Leaves & Brussels sprouts, beet greens, cabbages, dandelions, lettuce, sorrel, spinach, and watercress \\
\hline
Flowers & Cauliflower \\
\hline
Fruit & Beans, corn, cucumbers, okra, eggplant, peas, lentils, squash, and tomatoes. \\
\hline
\arrayrulecolor{black}
\end{tabular}

Young, tender vegetables,--as lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, watercress,
and tomatoes,--eaten uncooked, served separately or combined in salads,
help to stimulate a flagging appetite, and when dressed with oil furnish
considerable nutriment.

Beans, and peas when old, should be employed in making purées and soups;
by so doing, the outer covering of cellulose, so irritating to the
stomach, is removed.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Care Of Vegetables}

Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after gathering as possible;
in case they must be kept, spread on bottom of cool, dry,
well-ventilated cellar, or place in ice-box. Lettuce may be best kept by
sprinkling with cold water and placing in a tin pail closely covered.
Wilted vegetables may be freshened by allowing to stand in cold water.
Vegetables which contain sugar lose some of their sweetness by standing;
corn and peas are more quickly affected than others. Winter vegetables
should be kept in a cold, dry place. Beets, carrots, turnips, potatoes,
etc., should be put in barrels or piled in bins, to exclude as much air
as possible. Squash should be spread, and needs careful watching; when
dark spots appear, cook at once.

In using canned goods, empty contents from can as soon as opened, lest
the acid therein act on the tin to produce poisonous compounds, and let
stand one hour, that it may become reoxygenated. Beans, peas, asparagus,
etc., should be emptied into a strainer, drained, and cold water poured
over them and allowed to run through. In using dried vegetables, soak in
cold water several hours before cooking. A few years ago native
vegetables were alone sold; but now our markets are largely supplied
from the Southern States and California, thus allowing us fresh
vegetables throughout the year.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Cooking Of Vegetables}

A small scrubbing-brush, which may be bought for five cents, and two
small pointed knives for preparing vegetables should be found in every
kitchen.

Vegetables should be washed in cold water, and cooked until soft in
boiling salted water; if cooked in an uncovered vessel, their color is
better kept. For peas and beans add salt to water last half hour of
cooking. Time for cooking the same vegetable varies according to
freshness and age, therefore time tables for cooking serve only as
guides.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Mushrooms And Truffles}

These are classed among vegetables. Mushrooms, which grow about us
abundantly, may be easily gathered, and as they contain considerable
nutriment, should often be found on the table. While there are hundreds
of varieties, one by a little study may acquaint herself with a dozen or
more of the most common ones which are valuable as food. Consult W.
Hamilton Gibson, “Our Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms.” Many might cause
illness, but only a few varieties of the \textit{Amanita} family are deadly
poison. Mushrooms require heat and moisture,--a severe drought or very
wet soil being unfavorable for their growth. Never gather mushrooms in
the vicinity of decaying matter. They appear the middle of May, and last
until frost comes. \textit{Campestris} is the variety always found in market;
French canned are of this family. \textit{Boleti} are dried, canned, and sold
as \textit{cepes}.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Truffles}

Truffles belong to the same family as mushrooms, and are grown
underground. France is the most famous field for their production, from
which country they are exported in tin cans, and are too expensive for
ordinary use.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Artichokes}

French artichokes, imported throughout the year, are the ones
principally used. They retail from thirty to forty cents each, and are
cheapest and best in November, December, and January. Artichokes are
appearing in market from California and are somewhat cheaper in price
than the French Artichoke. Jerusalem artichokes are employed for
pickling, and can be bought for fifteen cents per quart.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Boiled Artichokes}

Cut off stem close to leaves, remove outside bottom leaves, trim
artichoke, cut off one inch from top of leaves, and with a sharp knife
remove choke; then tie artichoke with a string to keep its shape. Soak
one-half hour in cold water. Drain, and cook thirty to forty-five
minutes in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Remove from water, place
upside down to drain, then take off string. Serve with Béchamel or
Hollandaise Sauce. Boiled Artichokes often constitute a course at
dinner. Leaves are drawn out separately with fingers, dipped in sauce,
and fleshy ends only eaten, although the bottom is edible. Artichokes
may be cut in quarters, cooked, drained, and served with Sauce
Bearnaise. When prepared in this way they are served with mutton.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Fried Artichokes}

Sprinkle Boiled Artichokes cut in quarters with salt, pepper, and finely
chopped parsley. Dip in Batter I, fry in deep fat, and drain. In
preparing artichokes, trim off tops of leaves closer than when served as
Boiled Artichokes.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Artichoke Bottoms}

Remove all leaves and the choke. Trim bottoms in shape, and cook until
soft in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Serve with Hollandaise or
Béchamel Sauce.

Fill with Chicken Force-meat I or II, and bake thirty minutes in a
moderate oven, basting twice with Thin White Sauce. Remove to serving
dish and pour around Thin White Sauce.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Asparagus}

Hothouse asparagus is found in market during winter, but is not very
satisfactory, and is sold for about one dollar per bunch. Oyster Bay
(white asparagus) appears first of May, and commands a very high price.
Large and small green stalk asparagus is in season from first of June to
middle of July, and cheapest the middle of June.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Boiled Asparagus}

Cut off lower parts of stalks as far down as they will snap, untie
bunches, wash, remove scales, and retie. Cook in boiling salted water
fifteen minutes or until soft, leaving tips out of water first ten
minutes. Drain, remove string, and spread with soft butter, allowing one
and one-half tablespoons butter to each bunch asparagus. Asparagus is
often broken or cut in inch pieces for boiling, cooking tips a shorter
time than stalks.

\section*{Beans}

\textit{String Beans} that are obtainable in winter come from California;
natives appear in market the last of June and continue until the last of
September. There are two varieties, green (pole cranberry being best
flavored) and yellow (butter bean).

\textit{Shell Beans}, including horticultural and sieva, are sold in the pod or
shelled, five quarts in pod making one quart shelled. They are found in
market during July and August. Common lima and improved lima shell beans
are in season in August and September. Dried lima beans are procurable
throughout the year.

Kalamazoo variety, which grows white. To prepare celery for table, cut
off roots and leaves, separate stalks, wash, scrape, and chill in
ice-water. By adding a slice of lemon to ice-water celery is kept white
and made crisp. If tops of stalks are gashed several times before
putting in water, they will curl back and make celery look more
attractive.

\section*{Lettuce}

Lettuce is obtainable all the year, and is especially valuable during
the winter and spring, when other green vegetables in market command a
high price. Although containing but little nutriment, it is useful for
the large quantity of water and potash salts that it contains, and
assists in stimulating the appetite. Curly lettuce is of less value than
Tennis Ball, but makes an effective garnish.

Lettuce should be separated by removing leaves from stalk (discarding
wilted outer leaves), washed, kept in cold water until crisp, drained,
and so placed on a towel that water may drop from leaves. A bag made
from white mosquito netting is useful for drying lettuce. Wash lettuce
leaves, place in bag, and hang in lower part of ice-box to drain. Wire
baskets are used for the same purpose. Arrange lettuce for serving in
nearly its original shape.

\section*{Onions}

The onion belongs to the same family (Lily) as do \textit{shallot}, \textit{garlic},
\textit{leek}, and \textit{chive}. Onions are cooked and served as a vegetable. They
are wholesome, and contain considerable nutriment, but are objectionable
on account of the strong odor they impart to the breath, due to volatile
substances absorbed by the blood, and by the blood carried to the lungs,
where they are set free. The common garden onion is obtainable
throughout the year, the new ones appearing in market about the first of
June. In large centres Bermuda and Spanish onions are procurable from
March 1st to June 1st, and are of delicate flavor.

Shallot, leek, garlic, and chive are principally used to give additional
flavor to food. Shallot, garlic, and chive are used, to some extent, in
making salads.

\section*{Peas}

Peas contain, next to beans, the largest percentage of protein of any of
the vegetables, and when young are easy of digestion. They appear in
market as early as April, coming from Florida and California, and
although high in price are hardly worth buying, having been picked so
long. Native peas may be obtained the middle of June, and last until the
first of September. The early June are small peas, contained in a small
pod. McLean, the best peas, are small peas in large flat pods. Champion
peas are large, and the pods are well filled, but they lack sweetness.
Marrowfat peas are the largest in the market, and are usually sweet.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Boiled Peas}

Remove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let stand one-half
hour. Skim off undeveloped peas which rise to top of water, and drain
remaining peas. Cook until soft in a small quantity of boiling water,
adding salt the last fifteen minutes of cooking. (Consult Time Table for
Cooking, p. 28). There should be but little, if any, water to drain from
peas when they are cooked. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. If peas
have lost much of their natural sweetness, they are improved by the
addition of a small amount of sugar.

Radishes may be obtained throughout the year. There are round and long
varieties, the small round ones being considered best. They are bought
in bunches, six or seven constituting a bunch. Radishes are used merely
for a relish, and are served uncooked. To prepare radishes for table,
remove leaves, stems, and tip end of root, scrape roots, and serve on
crushed ice. Round radishes look very attractive cut to imitate tulips,
when they should not be scraped; to accomplish this, begin at root end
and make six incisions through skin running three-fourths length of
radish. Pass knife under sections of skin, and cut down as far as
incisions extend. Place in cold water, and sections of skin will fold
back, giving radish a tulip-like appearance.

\noindent
Potatoes stand pre-eminent among the vegetables used for food. They are
tubers belonging to the Nightshade family; their hardy growth renders
them easy of cultivation in almost any soil or climate, and, resisting
early frosts, they may be raised in a higher latitude than the cereals.

They give needed bulk to food rather than nutriment, and, lacking in
protein, should be used in combination with meat, fish, or eggs.

Potatoes contain an acrid juice, the greater part of which lies near the
skin; it passes into the water during boiling of potatoes, and escapes
with the steam from a baked potato.

Potatoes are best in the fall, and keep well through the winter. By
spring the starch is partially changed to dextrin, giving the potatoes a
sweetness, and when cooked a waxiness. The same change takes place when
potatoes are frozen. To prevent freezing, keep a pail of cold water
standing near them.

Potatoes keep best in a cool dry cellar, in barrels or piled in a bin.
When sprouts appear they should be removed; receiving their nourishment
from the starch, they deteriorate the potato.

New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, the starch-grains not
having reached maturity; therefore they should not be given to children
or invalids.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Sweet Potatoes}

Sweet potatoes, although analogous to white potatoes, are fleshy roots
of the plant, belong to a different family (Convolvulus), and contain a
much larger percentage of sugar. Our own country produces large
quantities of sweet potatoes, which may be grown as far north as New
Jersey and Southern Michigan. Kiln-dried sweet potatoes are the best, as
they do not so quickly spoil.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Baked Potatoes}

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a vegetable brush, and
place in dripping-pan. Bake in hot oven forty minutes or until soft,
remove from oven, and serve at once. If allowed to stand, unless the
skin is ruptured for escape of steam, they become soggy. Properly baked
potatoes are more easily digested than potatoes cooked in any other way,
as some of the starch is changed to dextrin by the intense heat. They
are better cooked in boiling water than baked in a slow oven.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Boiled Potatoes}

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, and drop at once in cold
water to prevent discoloration; soak one-half hour in the fall, and one
to two hours in winter and spring. Cook in boiling salted water until
soft, which is easily determined by piercing with a skewer. For seven
potatoes allow one tablespoon salt, and boiling water to cover. Drain
from water, and keep uncovered in warm place until serving time. Avoid
sending to table in a covered vegetable dish. In boiling large potatoes,
it often happens that outside is soft, while centre is underdone. To
finish cooking without potatoes breaking apart, add one pint cold water,
which drives heat to centre, thus accomplishing the cooking.

\chapter{Salads And Salad Dressings}



Salads, which constitute a course in almost every dinner, but a few
years since seldom appeared on the table. They are now made in an
endless variety of ways, and are composed of meat, fish, vegetables
(alone or in combination) or fruits, with the addition of a dressing.
The salad plants, lettuce, watercress, chiccory, cucumbers, etc.,
contain but little nutriment, but are cooling, refreshing, and assist in
stimulating the appetite. They are valuable for the water and potash
salts they contain. The olive oil, which usually forms the largest part
of the dressing, furnishes nutriment, and is of much value to the
system.

Salads made of greens should always be served crisp and cold. The
vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed to stand in cold or
ice-water until crisp, then drained and spread on a towel and set aside
in a cold place until serving time. See Lettuce, page 294. Dressing may
be added at table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed
to stand in dressing they will soon wilt. It should be remembered that
winter greens are raised under glass and should be treated as any other
hothouse plant. Lettuce will be affected by a change of temperature and
wilt just as quickly as delicate flowers.

Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well utilized in salads,
but are best mixed with French Dressing and allowed to stand in a cold
place one hour before serving. Where several vegetables are used in the
same salad they should be marinated separately, and arranged for serving
just before sending to table.

Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, cut in small
cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French Dressing before combining
with vegetables. Fish should be flaked or cut in cubes.

Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with salt and pepper,
add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vinegar is added before oil, the greens
will become wet, and oil will not cling, but settle to bottom of bowl.

\textbf{A Chapon.} Remove a small piece from end of French loaf and rub over
with a clove of garlic, first dipped in salt. Place in bottom of salad
bowl before arranging salad. A chapon is often used in vegetable salads,
and gives an agreeable additional flavor.

\textbf{To Marinate.} The word marinate, as used in cookery, means to add salt,
pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad ingredient or mixture, then allow to
let stand until well seasoned.

constantly. As mixture thickens, thin with vinegar or lemon juice. Add
oil, and vinegar or lemon juice alternately, until all is used, stirring
or beating constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a
curdled appearance. A smooth consistency may be restored by taking yolk
of another egg and adding curdled mixture slowly to it. It is desirable
to have bowl containing mixture placed in a larger bowl of crushed ice,
to which a small quantity of water has been added. Olive oil for making
Mayonnaise should always be thoroughly chilled. A silver fork, wire
whisk, small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater may be used as preferred.
If one has a Keystone Egg-beater, dressing may be made very quickly by
its use. Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon
liquefies when added to meat or vegetables; therefore it should be added
just before serving time.

Mix dry ingredients, add milk gradually, and beaten egg; then add olive
oil. Shape, using a hot timbale iron, fry in deep fat until crisp and
brown; take from iron and invert on brown paper to drain.

\textbf{To Heat Timbale Iron.} Heat fat until nearly hot enough to fry uncooked
mixtures. Put iron into hot fat, having fat deep enough to more than
cover it, and let stand until heated. The only way of knowing when iron
is of right temperature is to take it from fat, shake what fat may drip
from it, lower in batter to three-fourths its depth, raise from batter,
then immerse in hot fat. If batter does not cling to iron, or drops from
iron as soon as immersed in fat, it is either too hot or not
sufficiently heated.

\textbf{To Form Timbales.} Turn timbale batter into a cup. Lower hot iron into
cup, taking care that batter covers iron to only three-fourths its
depth. When immersed in fat, mixture will rise to top of iron, and when
crisp and brown may be easily slipped off. If too much batter is used,
in cooking it will rise over top of iron, and in order to remove timbale
it must be cut around with a sharp knife close to top of iron. If the
cases are soft rather than crisp, batter is too thick and must be
diluted with milk.

Fill cases with Creamed Oysters, Chicken, Sweetbreads, or Chicken and
Sweetbreads in combination with Mushrooms.

Aspic jelly is always made with meat stock, and is principally used in
elaborate entrées where fish, chicken, game, or vegetables are to be
served moulded in jelly. In making Aspic Jelly, use as much liquid as
the pan which is to contain moulded dish will hold.

Put vegetables, seasonings, and wine (except two tablespoons) in a
saucepan; cook eight minutes, and strain, reserving liquid. Add gelatine
to stock, then add lemon juice. Heat to boiling-point and add strained
liquid. Season with salt and cayenne. Beat whites of eggs slightly, add
two tablespoons wine, and dilute with one cup hot mixture. Add slowly to
remaining mixture, stirring constantly until boiling-point is reached.
Place on back of range and let stand thirty minutes. Strain through a
double cheese-cloth placed over a fine wire strainer, or through a jelly
bag.

\section*{Tomatoes In Aspic}

Peel six small firm tomatoes, and remove pulp, having opening in tops as
small as possible. Sprinkle insides with salt, invert, and let stand
thirty minutes. Fill with vegetable or chicken salad. Cover tops with
Mayonnaise to which has been added a small quantity of dissolved
gelatine, and garnish with capers and sliced pickles. Place a pan in
ice-water, cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, and let stand until
jelly is firm. Arrange tomatoes on jelly garnished side down. Add more
aspic jelly mixture, let stand until firm, and so continue until all is
used. Chill thoroughly, turn on a serving dish, and garnish around base
with parsley.

\section*{Stuffed Olives In Aspic}

Stone olives, using an olive stoner, and fill cavities thus made with
green butter. Place small Dario moulds in pan of ice-water, and pour in
aspic jelly mixture (see p. 382) one-fourth inch deep. When firm put an
olive in each mould (keeping olives in place by means of small wooden
skewers) and add aspic by spoonfuls until moulds are filled. Chill
thoroughly, remove to circular slices of liver sausage, garnish with
green butter forced through a pastry bag and tube, yolks of
“hard-boiled” eggs forced through a strainer, and red peppers cut in
fancy shapes.

\textbf{Green Butter.} Mix yolk one “hard-boiled” egg, two tablespoons butter,
one sprig parsley, one sprig tarragon, one small shallot, one-half
teaspoon anchovy paste, one teaspoon capers, and one teaspoon chopped
gherkins, and pound in a mortar; then rub through a very fine sieve.
Season with salt and pepper, and add a few drops vinegar.

\section*{Tongue In Aspic}

Cook a tongue according to directions on page 210. After removing skin
and roots, run a skewer through tip of tongue and fleshy part, thus
keeping tongue in shape. When cool, remove skewer. Put a round pan in
ice-water, cover bottom with brown aspic, and when firm decorate with
cooked carrot, turnip, beet cut in fancy shapes, and parsley. Cover with
aspic jelly mixture, adding it by spoonfuls so as not to disarrange
vegetables. When this layer of mixture is firm, put in tongue, adding
gradually remaining mixture as in Tomatoes in Aspic.

\section*{Birds In Aspic}

Clean, bone, stuff, and truss a bird, then steam over body bones or
roast. If roasted, do not dredge with flour. Put a pan in ice-water,
cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, and when firm garnish with
truffles and egg custard thinly sliced and cut in fancy shapes. The
smaller the shapes the more elaborate may be the designs. When
garnishing with small shapes, pieces are so difficult to handle that
they should be taken on the pointed end of a larding-needle, and placed
as desired on jelly. Add aspic mixture by spoonfuls, that designs may
not be disturbed. When mixture is added, and firm to the depth of
three-fourths inch, place in the bird, breast down. If sides of mould
are to be decorated, dip pieces in jelly and they will cling to pan. Add
remaining mixture gradually as in Tomatoes in Aspic. Small birds,
chicken, capon, or turkey, may be put in aspic.

\section*{To Whip Cream}

Thin and heavy cream are both used in making and garnishing desserts.

\textit{Heavy cream} is bought in half-pint, pint, and quart glass jars, and
usually retails at sixty cents per quart; \textit{thin} or \textit{strawberry cream}
comes in glass jars or may be bought in bulk, and usually retails for
thirty cents per quart. Heavy cream is very rich; for which reason, when
whipped without being diluted, it is employed as a garnish; even when so
used, it is generally diluted with one-fourth to one-third its bulk in
milk; when used in combination with other ingredients for making
desserts, it is diluted from one-half to two-thirds its bulk in milk.
Thin cream is whipped without being diluted. Cream should be thoroughly
chilled for whipping. Turn cream to be whipped into a bowl (care being
taken not to select too large a bowl), and set in pan of crushed ice, to
which water is added that cream may be quickly chilled; without addition
of water, cream will not be so thoroughly chilled.

For whipping heavy cream undiluted, or diluted with one-third or less
its bulk in milk, use Dover egg-beater; undiluted heavy cream if beaten
a moment too long will come to butter. Heavy cream diluted, whipped,
sweetened, and flavored, is often served with puddings, and called Cream
Sauce.

Thin cream is whipped by using a whip churn, as is heavy cream when
diluted with one-half to two-thirds its bulk in milk. Place churn in
bowl containing cream, hold down cover with left hand, with right hand
work dasher with quick downward and slow upward motions; avoid raising
dasher too high in cylinder, thus escaping spattering of cream. The
first whip which appears should be stirred into cream, as air bubbles
are too large and will break; second whip should be removed by spoonfuls
to a strainer, strainer to be placed in a pan, as some cream will drain
through. The first cream which drains through may be turned into bowl to
be rewhipped, and continue whipping as long as possible.

There will be some cream left in bowl which does not come above
perforations in whip churn, and cannot be whipped. Cream which remains
may be scalded and used to dissolve gelatine when making desserts which
require gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. By following
these directions one need have no difficulty, if cream is of right

\chapter{Ices, Ice Creams, And Other Frozen Desserts}



Ices and other frozen dishes comprise the most popular desserts.
Hygienically speaking, they cannot be recommended for the final course
of a dinner, as cold mixtures reduce the temperature of the stomach,
thus retarding digestion until the normal temperature is again reached.
But how cooling, refreshing, and nourishing, when properly taken, and of
what inestimable value in the sick room!

Frozen dishes include:

\textit{Water ice},--fruit juice sweetened, diluted with water, and frozen.

\textit{Sherbet},--water ice to which is added a small quantity of dissolved
gelatine or beaten whites of eggs.

\textit{Frappé},--water ice frozen to consistency of mush; in freezing, equal
parts of salt and ice being used to make it granular.

\textit{Punch},--water ice to which is added spirit and spice.

\textit{Sorbet},--strictly speaking, frozen punch; the name is often given to a
water ice where several kinds of fruit are used.

\textit{Philadelphia Ice Cream},--thin cream, sweetened, flavored, and frozen.

\textit{Plain Ice Cream},--custard foundation, thin cream, and flavoring.

\textit{Mousse},--heavy cream, beaten until stiff, sweetened, flavored, placed
in a mould, packed in salt and ice (using two parts crushed ice to one
part salt), and allowed to stand three hours; or whip from thin cream
may be used folded into mixture containing small quantity of gelatine.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{How To Freeze Desserts}

The prejudice of thinking a frozen dessert difficult to prepare has long
since been overcome. With ice cream freezer, burlap bag, wooden mallet
or axe, small saucepan, sufficient ice and coarse rock salt, the process
neither takes much time nor patience. Snow may be used instead of ice;
if not readily acted on by salt, pour in one cup cold water. Crush ice
finely by placing in bag and giving a few blows with mallet or broad
side of axe; if there are any coarse pieces, remove them. Place can
containing mixture to be frozen in wooden tub, cover, and adjust top.
Turn crank to make sure can fits in socket. Allow three level measures
ice to one of salt, and repeat until ice and salt come to top of can,
packing solidly, using handle of mallet to force it down. If only small
quantity is to be frozen, the ice and salt need come only a little
higher in the tub than mixture to be frozen. These are found the best
proportions of ice and salt to insure smooth, fine-grained cream,
sherbet, or water ice, while equal parts of salt and ice are used for
freezing frappé. If a larger proportion of salt is used, mixture will
freeze in shorter time and be of granular consistency, which is
desirable only for frappé.

The mixture increases in bulk during freezing, so the can should never
be more than three-fourths filled; by overcrowding can, cream will be
made coarse-grained. Turn the crank slowly and steadily to expose as
large surface of mixture as possible to ice and salt. After frozen to a
mush, the crank may be turned more rapidly, adding more ice and salt if
needed; never draw off salt water until mixture is frozen, unless there
is possibility of its getting into the can, for salt water is what
effects freezing; until ice melts, no change will take place. After
freezing is accomplished, draw off water, remove dasher, and with spoon
pack solidly. Put cork in opening of cover, then put on cover. Re-pack
freezer, using four measures ice to one of salt. Place over top
newspapers or piece of carpet; when serving time comes, remove can, wipe
carefully, and place in vessel of cool water; let stand one minute,
remove cover, and run a knife around edge of cream, invert can on
serving dish, and frozen mixture will slip out. Should there be any
difficulty, a cloth wrung out of hot water, passed over can, will aid in
removing mixture.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{To Line A Mould}

Allow mould to stand in salt and ice until well chilled. Remove cover,
put in mixture by spoonfuls, and spread with back of spoon or a case
knife evenly three-quarters inch thick.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{To Mould Frozen Mixtures}

When frozen mixtures are to be bricked or moulded, avoid freezing too
hard. Pack mixture solidly in moulds and cover with buttered paper,
buttered side up. Have moulds so well filled that mixture is forced down
sides of mould when cover is pressed down. Re-pack in salt and ice,
using four parts ice to one part salt. If these directions are carefully
followed, one may feel no fear that salt water will enter cream, even
though moulds be immersed in salt water.

\chapter{Pastry}



Pastry cannot be easily excluded from the menu of the New Englander. Who
can dream of a Thanksgiving dinner without a pie! The last decade has
done much to remove pies from the \textit{daily} bill of fare, and in their
place are found delicate puddings and seasonable fruits.

If pastry is to be served, have it of the best,--light, flaky, and
tender.

To pastry belongs, 1st, Puff Paste; 2d, Plain Paste.

Puff paste, which to many seems so difficult of preparation, is rarely
attempted by any except professionals. As a matter of fact, one who has
never handled a rolling-pin is less liable to fail, under the guidance
of a good teacher, than an old cook, who finds it difficult to overcome
the bad habit of using too much force in rolling. It is necessary to
work rapidly and with a light touch. A cold room is of great advantage.

For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shortenings, thoroughly
chilled, are essential. Its lightness depends on the amount of air
enclosed and expansion of that air in baking. The flakiness depends upon
kind and amount of shortening used. Lard makes more tender crust than
butter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. Puff paste is usually
shortened with butter, though some chefs prefer beef suet. Eggs and ice
were formerly used, but are not essentials.

Butter should be washed if pastry is to be of the best, so as to remove
salt and buttermilk, thus making it of a waxy consistency, easy to
handle.





\textbf{Rules for Washing Butter.} Scald and chill an earthen bowl. Heat palms
of hands in hot water, and chill in cold water. By following these
directions, butter will not adhere to bowl nor hands. Wash butter in
bowl by squeezing with hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl under a
cold-water faucet and allowing water to run. A small amount of butter
may be washed by using a wooden spoon in place of the hands.

For rolling paste, use a smooth wooden board, and wooden rolling-pin
with handles.

Puff paste should be used for vol-au-vents, patties, rissoles, bouchées,
cheese straws, tarts, etc. It may be used for rims and upper crusts of
pies, but never for lower crusts. Plain paste may be used where pastry
is needed, except for vol-au-vents and patties.

\section*{Puff Paste}


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item 1 pound butter
\item 1 pound pastry flour
\item Cold water
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies. Reserve two
tablespoons of butter, and shape remainder into a circular piece
one-half inch thick, and put on floured board. Work two tablespoons of
butter into flour with the tips of fingers of the right hand. Moisten to
a dough with cold water, turn on slightly floured board, and knead one
minute. Cover with towel, and let stand five minutes.

Pat and roll one-fourth inch thick, keeping paste a little wider than
long, and corners square. If this cannot be accomplished with
rolling-pin, draw into shape with fingers. Place butter on centre of
lower half of paste. Cover butter by folding upper half of paste over
it. Press edges firmly, to enclose as much air as possible.

Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, the left side under
enclosed butter. Turn paste half-way round, cover, and let stand five
minutes. Pat, and roll one-fourth inch thick, having paste longer than
wide, lifting often to prevent paste from sticking, and dredging board
slightly with flour when necessary. Fold from ends towards centre,
making three layers. Cover, and let stand five minutes. Repeat twice,
turning paste half-way round each time before rolling. After fourth
rolling, fold from ends to centre, and double, making four layers. Put
in cold place to chill; if outside temperature is not sufficiently cold,
fold paste in a towel, put in a dripping-pan, and place between dripping
pans of crushed ice. If paste is to be kept for several days, wrap in a
napkin, put in tin pail and cover tightly, then put in cold place; if in
ice box, do not allow pail to come in direct contact with ice.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{To Bake Puff Paste}

Baking of puff paste requires as much care and judgment as making. After
shaping, chill thoroughly before baking. Puff paste requires hot oven,
greatest heat coming from the bottom, that the paste may properly rise.
While rising it is often necessary to decrease the heat by lifting
covers or opening the check to stove. Turn frequently, that it may rise
evenly. When it has risen its full height, slip a pan under the sheet on
which paste is baking to prevent burning on the bottom. Puff paste
should be baked on a tin sheet covered with a double thickness of brown
paper, or dripping-pan may be used, lined with brown paper. The
temperature for baking of patties should be about the same as for raised
biscuit; vol-au-vents require less heat, and are covered for first
half-hour to prevent scorching on top.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Patty Shells}

Roll puff paste one-quarter inch thick, shape with a patty cutter, first
dipped in flour; remove centres from one-half the rounds with smaller
cutter. Brush over with cold water the larger pieces near the edge, and
fit on rings, pressing lightly. Place in towel between pans of crushed
ice, and chill until paste is stiff; if cold weather, chill out of
doors. Place on iron or tin sheet covered with brown paper, and bake
twenty-five minutes in hot oven. The shells should rise their full
height and begin to brown in twelve to fifteen minutes; continue
browning, and finish baking in twenty-five minutes. Pieces cut from
centre of rings of patties may be baked and used for patty covers, or
put together, rolled, and cut for unders. Trimmings from puff paste
should be carefully laid on top of each other, patted, and rolled out.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Vol-Au-Vents}

Roll puff paste one-third inch thick, mark an oval on paste with cutter
or mould, and cut out with sharp knife, first dipped in flour. Brush
over near the edge with cold water, put on a rim three-fourths inch
wide, press lightly, chill, and bake. Vol-au-vents require for baking
forty-five minutes to one hour. During the first half-hour they should
be covered, watched carefully, and frequently turned. The paste cut from
centre of rim should be rolled one-quarter inch thick, shaped same size
as before rolling, chilled, baked, and used for cover to the
Vol-au-vent.

butter as for puff paste, pat, and roll out. Fold so as to make three
layers, turn half-way round, pat, and roll out; repeat. The pastry may
be used at once; if not, fold in cheese-cloth, put in covered tin, and
keep in cold place, but never in direct contact with ice. Plain paste
requires a moderate oven. This is superior paste and quickly made.

Mix salt with flour. Reserve one and one-fourth tablespoons lard, work
in remainder to flour, using tips of fingers or a case knife. Moisten to
a dough with water. Toss on a floured board, pat, and roll out. Spread
with one tablespoon reserved lard, dredge with flour, roll up like a
jelly roll, pat, and roll out; again roll up. Cut from the end of roll a
piece large enough to line a pie plate. Pat and roll out, keeping the
paste as circular in form as possible. With care and experience there
need be no trimmings. Worked-over pastry is never as satisfactory. The
remaining one-fourth tablespoon lard is used to dot over upper crust of
pie just before sending to oven; this gives the pie a flaky appearance.
Ice-water has a similar effect. If milk is brushed over the pie it has a
glazed appearance. This quantity of paste will make one pie with two
crusts and a few puffs, or two pies with one crust where the rim is
built up and fluted.

Serve with salad course.





\chapter{Pies}



Paste for pies should be one-fourth inch thick and rolled a little
larger than the plate to allow for shrinking. In dividing paste for
pies, allow more for upper than under crusts. Always perforate upper
crusts that steam may escape. Some make a design, others pierce with a
large fork.

Flat rims for pies should be cut in strips three-fourths inch wide.
Under crusts should be brushed with cold water before putting on rims,
and rims slightly fulled, otherwise they will shrink from edge of plate.
The pastry jagger, a simple device for cutting paste, makes rims with
fluted edges.

Pies requiring two crusts sometimes have a rim between the crusts. This
is mostly confined to mince pieces, where there is little danger of
juice escaping. Sometimes a rim is placed over upper crust. Where two
pieces of paste are put together, the under piece should always be
brushed with cold water, the upper piece placed over, and the two
pressed lightly together; otherwise they will separate during baking.

When juicy fruit is used for filling pies, some of the juices are apt to
escape during baking. As a precaution, bind with a strip of cotton cloth
wrung out of cold water and cut one inch wide and long enough to
encircle the plate. Squash, pumpkin, and custard pies are much less care
during baking when bound. Where cooked fruits are used for filling, it
is desirable to bake crusts separately. This is best accomplished by
covering an inverted deep pie plate with paste and baking for under
crust. Prick with a fork before baking. Slip from plate, and fill. For
upper crusts, roll a piece of paste a little larger than the pie plate,
prick, and bake on a tin sheet.

For baking pies, perforated tin plates are used. They may be bought
shallow or deep. By the use of such plates the under crust is well
cooked. Pastry should be thoroughly baked and well browned. Pies require
from thirty-five to forty-five minutes for baking. Never grease a pie
plate; good pastry greases its own tin. Slip pies, when slightly cooled,
to earthen plates.

Cover meat and suet with boiling water and cook until tender, cool in
water in which they are cooked; the suet will rise to top, forming a
cake of fat, which may be easily removed. Finely chop meat, and add it
to twice the amount of finely chopped apples. The apples should be
quartered, cored, and pared, previous to chopping, or skins may be left
on, which is not an objection if apples are finely chopped. Add quinces
finely chopped, sugar, molasses, cider, raisins, currants, and citron;
also suet, and stock in which meat and suet were cooked, reduced to one
and one-half cups. Heat gradually, stir occasionally, and cook slowly
two hours; then add brandy and spices.

\subsection*{For Pies, Puddings, and Desserts}

Eggs for meringues should be thoroughly chilled, and beaten with silver
fork, wire spoon, or whisk. Where several eggs are needed, much time is
saved by using a whisk. Meringues on pies, puddings, or desserts may be
spread evenly, spread and piled in the centre, put on lightly by
spoonfuls, or spread evenly with part of the mixture, the remainder
being forced through a pastry bag and tube.

Meringues I and III should be baked fifteen minutes in slow oven.
Meringue II should be cooked eight minutes in moderate oven; if removed
from oven before cooked, the eggs will liquefy and meringue settle; if
cooked too long, meringue is tough.

\chapter{Cake}



The mixing and baking of cake requires more care and judgment than any
other branch of cookery; notwithstanding, it seems the one most
frequently attempted by the inexperienced.

Two kinds of cake mixtures are considered:

I. Without butter. Example: Sponge Cakes.

II. With butter. Examples: Cup and Pound Cakes.

In cake making (1) the best ingredients are essential; (2) great care
must be taken in measuring and combining ingredients; (3) pans must be
properly prepared; (4) oven heat must be regulated, and cake watched
during baking.

Best tub butter, fine granulated sugar, fresh eggs, and pastry flour are
essentials for good cake. Coarse granulated sugar, bought by so many, if
used in cake making, gives a coarse texture and hard crust. Pastry flour
contains more starch and less gluten than bread flour, therefore makes a
lighter, more tender cake. If bread flour must be used, allow two
tablespoons less for each cup than the recipe calls for. Flour differs
greatly in thickening properties; for this reason it is always well when
using from a new bag to try a small cake, as the amount of flour given
may not make the perfect loaf. In winter, cake may be made of less flour
than in summer.

Before attempting to mix cake, study How to Measure (p. 25) and How to
Combine Ingredients (p. 26).

Look at the fire, and replenish by sprinkling on a small quantity of
coal if there is not sufficient heat to effect the baking.

\textbf{To Mix Sponge Cake.} Separate yolks from whites of eggs. Beat yolks
until thick and lemon-colored, using an egg-beater; add sugar gradually,
and continue beating; then add flavoring. Beat whites until stiff and
dry,--when they will fly from the beater,--and add to the first mixture.
Mix and sift flour with salt, and cut and fold in at the last. If
mixture is beaten after the addition of flour, much of the work already
done of enclosing a large amount of air will be undone by breaking air
bubbles. These rules apply to a mixture where baking powder is not
employed.

\textbf{To Mix Butter Cakes.} An earthen bowl should always be used for mixing
cake, and a wooden cake-spoon with slits lightens the labor. Measure dry
ingredients, and mix and sift baking powder and spices, if used, with
flour. Count out number of eggs required, breaking each separately that
there may be no loss should a stale egg chance to be found in the
number, separating yolks from whites if rule so specifies. Measure
butter, then liquid. Having everything in readiness, the mixing may be
quickly accomplished. If butter is very hard, by allowing it to stand a
short time in a warm room it is measured and creamed much easier. If
time cannot be allowed for this to be done, warm bowl by pouring in some
hot water, letting stand one minute, then emptying and wiping dry. Avoid
overheating bowl, as butter will become oily rather than creamy. Put
butter in bowl, and cream by working with a wooden spoon until soft and
of a creamy consistency; then add sugar gradually, and continue beating.
Add yolks of eggs or whole eggs beaten until light, liquid, and flour
mixed and sifted with baking powder; or liquid and flour may be added
alternately. When yolks and whites of eggs are beaten separately, whites
are usually added at the last, as is the case when whites of eggs alone
are used. A cake can be made fine-grained only by long beating, although
light and delicate with a small amount of beating. Never stir cake after
the final beating, remembering that beating motion should always be the
last used. Fruit, when added to cake, is usually floured to prevent its
settling to the bottom. This is not necessary if it is added directly
after the sugar, which is desirable in all dark cakes. If a light fruit
cake is made, fruit added in this way discolors the loaf. Citron is
first cut in thin slices, then in strips, floured, and put in between
layers of cake mixtures. Raisins are seeded and cut, rather than
chopped. \textit{To seed raisins}, wet tips of fingers in a cup of warm water.
Then break skins with fingers or cut with a vegetable knife; remove
seeds, and put in cup of water. This is better than covering raisins
with warm water; if this be done, water clings to fruit, and when
dredged with flour a pasty mass is formed on the outside. Washed
currants, put up in packages, are quite free from stems and foreign
substances, and need only picking over and rolling in flour. Currants
bought in bulk need thorough cleaning. First roll in flour, which helps
to start dirt; wash in cold water, drain, and spread to dry; then roll
again in flour before using.

\textbf{To Butter and Fill Pans.} Grease pans with melted fat, applying the
same with a butter brush. If butter is used, put in a small saucepan and
place on back of range; when melted, salt will settle to the bottom;
butter is then called \textit{clarified}. Just before putting in mixture,
dredge pans thoroughly with flour, invert, and shake pan to remove all
superfluous flour, leaving only a thin coating which adheres to butter.
This gives to cake a smooth under surface, which is especially desirable
if cake is to be frosted. Pans may be lined with paper. If this is done,
paper should just cover bottom of pan and project over sides. Then ends
of pan and paper are buttered.

In filling pans, have the mixture come well to the corners and sides of
pans, leaving a slight depression in the centre, and when baked the cake
will be perfectly flat on top. Cake pans should be filled nearly
two-thirds full if cake is expected to rise to top of pan.

\textbf{To Bake Cake.} The baking of cake is more critical than the mixing.
Many a well-mixed cake has been spoiled in the baking. No oven
thermometer has yet proved practical, and although many teachers of
cookery have given oven tests, experience alone has proved the most
reliable teacher. In baking cake, divide the time required into
quarters. During the first quarter the mixture should begin to rise;
second quarter, continue rising and begin to brown; third quarter,
continue browning; fourth quarter, finish baking and shrink from pan. If
oven is too hot, open check and raise back covers, or leave oven door
ajar. It is sometimes necessary to cover cake with brown paper; there
is, however, danger of cake adhering to paper. Cake should be often
looked at during baking, and providing oven door is opened and closed
carefully, there is no danger of this causing cake to fall. Cake should
not be moved in oven until it has risen its full height; after this it
is usually desirable to move it that it may be evenly browned. Cake when
done shrinks from the pan, and in most cases this is a sufficient test;
however, in pound cakes this rule does not apply. Pound and rich fruit
cakes are tested by pressing surface with tip of finger. If cake feels
firm to touch and follows finger back into place, it is safe to remove
it from the oven. When baking cake arrange to have nothing else in the
oven, and place loaf or loaves as near the centre of oven as possible.
If placed close to fire-box, one side of loaf is apt to become burned
before sufficiently risen to turn. If cake is put in too slow an oven,
it often rises over sides of pan and is of very coarse texture; if put
in too hot an oven, it browns on top before sufficiently risen, and in
its attempt to rise breaks through the crust, thus making an unsightly
loaf. Cake will also crack on top if too much flour has been used. The
oven should be kept at as nearly uniform temperature as possible. Small
and layer cakes require a hotter oven than loaf cakes.

\textbf{To Remove Cake From Pans.} Remove cake from pans as soon as it comes
from the oven, by inverting pan on a wire cake cooler, or on a board
covered with a piece of old linen. If cake is inclined to stick, do not
hurry it from pan, but loosen with knife around edges, and rest pan on
its four sides successively; thus by its own weight cake may be helped
out.

\textbf{To Frost Cake.} Where cooked frostings are used, it makes but little
difference whether they are spread on hot or cold cake. Where uncooked
frostings are used, it is best to have the cake slightly warm, with the
exception of Confectioners' Frosting, where boiling water is employed.

Genuine sponge cake contains no rising properties, but is made light by
the quantity of air beaten into both yolks and whites of eggs, and the
expansion of that air in baking. It requires a slow oven. All so-called
sponge cakes which have the addition of soda and cream of tartar or
baking powder require same oven temperature as butter cakes. When
failures are made in Sunshine and Angel Cake, they are usually traced to
baking in too slow an oven, and removing from oven before thoroughly

\section*{Fondant Icing}

The mixture in which small cakes are dipped for icing is fondant, the
recipe for which may be found in chapter on Confections. Cakes for
dipping must first be glazed.

\textbf{To Glaze Cakes.} Beat white of one egg slightly, and add one tablespoon
powdered sugar. Apply with a brush to top and sides of cakes. After
glazing, cakes should stand over night before dipping.

\textbf{To Dip Cakes.} Melt fondant over hot water, and color and flavor as
desired. Stir, to prevent crust from forming on top. Take cake to be
dipped on a three-tined fork and lower in fondant three-fourths the
depth of cake. Remove from fondant, invert, and slip from fork to a
board. Decorate with ornamental frosting and nut meat, candied cherries,
angelica, or candied violets. For small ornamented cakes, pound cake
mixture is baked a little more than one inch thick in shallow pans, and
when cool cut in squares, diamonds, triangles, circles, crescents, etc.

tube. After first coating on cake has hardened, cover with a thicker
layer, and crease for cutting. If frosting is too stiff to spread
smoothly, thin with a few drops of water. With a pastry bag and variety
of tubes, cake may be ornamented as desired.

\noindent%
Put eggs in a large bowl, add two tablespoons sugar, and beat three
minutes, using a perforated wooden spoon. Repeat until one and one-half
cups sugar are used. Add lemon juice gradually, as mixture thickens.
Continue adding sugar by spoonfuls, and beating until frosting is stiff
enough to spread. This may be determined by taking up some of mixture on
back of spoon, and with a case knife making a cut through mixture; if
knife makes a clean cut and frosting remains parted, it is of right
consistency. Spread cake thinly with frosting; when this has hardened,
put on a thicker layer, having mixture somewhat stiffer than first
coating, and then crease for cutting. To remaining frosting add enough
more sugar, that frosting may keep in shape after being forced through a
pastry bag and tube.

With a pastry bag and variety of tubes, cake may be ornamented as
desired.









\chapter{Fancy Cakes And Confections}



Almond paste for making macaroons and small fancy cakes may be bought of
dealers who keep confectioners' supplies, although sometimes a resident
baker or confectioner will sell a small quantity. Almond paste is put up
in five-pound tin pails, and retails for one and one-half dollars per
pail. During the cold weather it will keep after being opened for a long
time.

\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Work together almond paste and sugar on a smooth board or marble slab.
Then add whites of eggs gradually, and work until mixture is perfectly
smooth. Confectioners at first use the hand, afterwards a palette knife,
which is not only of use for mixing but for keeping board clean. Shape,
using a pastry bag and tube, on a tin sheet covered with buttered paper,
one-half inch apart; or drop mixture from tip of spoon in small piles.
Macaroon mixture is stiff enough to hold its shape, but in baking
spreads. Bake fifteen to twenty minutes in a slow oven. If liked soft,
they should be slightly baked. After removing from oven, invert paper,
and wet with a cloth wrung out of cold water, when macaroons will easily
slip off.

using a rolling-pin. After rolling the piece should be four inches wide.
Spread with frosting made of white of one egg and two-thirds cup
confectioners' sugar beaten together until stiff enough to spread. Cut
in strips four inches long by three-fourths inch wide. This must be
quickly done, as a crust soon forms over frosting. To accomplish this,
use two knives, one placed through mixture where dividing line is to be
made, and the other used to make a clean sharp cut on both sides of
first knife. Knives should be kept clean by wiping on a damp cloth.
Remove strips as soon as cut, to a tin sheet, greased with lard and then
floured. Bake twenty minutes on centre grate in a slow oven.

\section*{Salted Almonds I}

Blanch one-fourth pound Jordan almonds and dry on a towel. Put one-third
cup olive oil in a very small saucepan. When hot, put in one-fourth of
the almonds and fry until delicately browned, stirring to keep almonds
constantly in motion. Remove with a spoon or small skimmer, taking up as
little oil as possible. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt;
repeat until all are fried. It may be necessary to remove some of the
salt by wiping nuts with a napkin.

An iron kettle with a rounding bottom (Scotch kettle) or copper kettle
is best for candy making. If one has no copper kettle, a granite kettle
is best for sugar candies.

Put butter in kettle, place over fire, and when melted, add molasses and
sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. During the first of the boiling
stirring is unnecessary, but when nearly cooked, it should be constantly
stirred. Boil until, when tried in cold water, mixture will become
brittle. Add vinegar just before taking from fire. Pour into a well
buttered pan. When cool enough to handle, pull until porous and
light-colored, allowing candy to come in contact with tips of fingers
and thumbs, not to be squeezed in the hand. Cut in small pieces, using
large shears or a sharp knife, and then arrange on slightly buttered
plates to cool.

\section*{Boiled Sugar For Confections}

Eleven tests are considered for boiling sugar:


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Small thread: 215deg F.
\item Large thread: 217deg
\item Pearl:        220deg
\item Large pearl:  222deg
\item The blow:     230deg
\item The feather:  232deg
\item Soft ball:    238deg
\item Hard ball:    248deg
\item Small crack:  290deg
\item Crack:        310deg
\item Caramel:      350deg
\end{itemize}


Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of sugar and water
boiled together (with a small quantity of cream of tartar to prevent
sugar from granulating) to soft ball, 238deg F. The professional
confectioner is able to decide when syrup has boiled to the right
temperature by sound while boiling, and by testing in cold water; these
tests at first seem somewhat difficult to the amateur, but only a little
experience is necessary to make fondant successfully. A sugar
thermometer is often employed, and proves valuable, as by its use one
need not exercise his judgment.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{White Fondant}


\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item 2 1/2 lbs. sugar
\item 1 1/2 cups hot water
\item 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.5em}
\noindent%
Put ingredients into a smooth granite stewpan. Stir, place on range, and
heat gradually to boiling-point. Boil without stirring until, when tried
in cold water, a soft ball may be formed that will just keep in shape,
which is 238deg F. After a few minutes' boiling, sugar will adhere to
sides of kettle; this should be washed off with the hand first dipped in
cold water. Have a pan of cold water near at hand, dip hand in cold
water, then quickly wash off a small part of the sugar with tips of
fingers, and repeat until all sugar adhering to side of saucepan is
removed. If this is quickly done, there is no danger of burning the
fingers. Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble slab. Let stand a few
minutes to cool, but not long enough to become hard around the edge.
Scrape fondant with chopping knife to one end of marble, and work with a
wooden spatula until white and creamy. It will quickly change from this
consistency, and begin to lump, when it should be kneaded with the hands
until perfectly smooth.

Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper to exclude air, that a crust may
not form on top, and let stand twenty-four hours. A large oiled platter
and wooden spoon may be used in place of marble slab and spatula. Always
make fondant on a clear day, as a damp, heavy atmosphere has an
unfavorable effect on the boiling of sugar.

\subsection*{Bonbons}

The centres of bonbons are made of fondant shaped in small balls. If
White Fondant is used, flavor as desired,--vanilla being usually
preferred. For cocoanut centres, work as much shredded cocoanut as
possible into a small quantity of fondant; for nut centres, surround
pieces of nut meat with fondant, using just enough to cover. French
candied cherries are often used in this way. Allow balls to stand over
night, and dip the following day.

\textbf{To Dip Bonbons.} Put fondant in saucepan, and melt over hot water;
color and flavor as desired. In coloring fondant, dip a small wooden
skewer in coloring paste, take up a small quantity, and dip skewer in
fondant. If care is not taken, the color is apt to be too intense.
During dipping, keep fondant over hot water that it may be kept of right
consistency. For dipping, use a two-tined fork or confectioners' bonbon
dipper. Drop centres in fondant one at a time, stir until covered,
remove from fondant, put on oiled paper, and bring end of dipper over
the top of bonbon, thus leaving a tail-piece which shows that bonbons
have been hand dipped. Stir fondant between dippings to prevent a crust
from forming.

\subsection*{Cream Mints}

Melt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops of oil of
peppermint, wintergreen, clove, cinnamon, or orange, and color if
desired. Drop from tip of spoon on oiled paper. Confectioners use rubber

\chapter{Sandwiches And Canapés}



In preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as thinly as possible, and
remove crusts. If butter is used, cream the butter, and spread bread
before cutting from loaf. Spread half the slices with mixture to be used
for filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cut in squares, oblongs,
or triangles. If sandwiches are shaped with round or fancy cutters,
bread should be shaped before spreading, that there may be no waste of
butter. Sandwiches which are prepared several hours before serving time
may be kept fresh and moist by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as
possible out of hot water, and keeping in a cool place. Paraffine paper
is often used for the same purpose. Bread for sandwiches cuts better
when a day old. Serve sandwiches piled on a plate covered with a doily.

\chapter{Recipes For The Chafing-Dish}



The chafing-dish, which, within the last few years, has gained so much
favor, is by no means a utensil of modern invention, as its history may
be traced to the time of Louis XIV. It finds its place on the breakfast
table, when the eggs may be cooked to suit the most fastidious; on the
luncheon table, when a dainty hot dish may be prepared to serve in place
of the so-oft-seen cold meat; but it is made of greatest use for the
cooking of late suppers, and always seems to accompany hospitality and
good cheer.

It is appreciated and enjoyed by the housekeeper who does her own work,
or has but one maid, as well as by the society girl who, by its use,
first gains a taste for the art of cooking. The simple tin
chafing-dishes may be bought for as small a sum as ninety cents, while
the elaborate silver ones command as high a price as one hundred
dollars. Very attractive dishes are made of granite ware, nickel, or
copper. The latest patterns have the lamp with a screw adjustment to
regulate the flame, and a metal tray on which to set dish, that it may
be moved if necessary while hot, without danger of burnt fingers, and
that it may not injure the polished table.

A chafing-dish has two pans, the under one for holding hot water, the
upper one with long handle for holding food to be cooked. A blazer
differs from a chafing-dish, inasmuch as it has no hot-water pan.

Wood alcohol, which is much lower in price than high-proof spirits, is
generally used in chafing-dishes.

The Davy Toaster may be used over the chafing-dish for toasting bread
and broiling.

\chapter{Fruits: Fresh, Preserved, And Canned}



Fruits are usually at their best when served ripe and in season;
however, a few cannot be taken in their raw state, and still others are
rendered more easy of digestion by cooking. The methods employed are
stewing and baking. Fruit should be cooked in earthen or granite ware
utensils, and silver or wooden spoons should be employed for stirring.
It must be remembered that all fruits contain one or more acids, and
when exposed to air and brought in contact with an iron or tin surface,
a poisonous compound may be formed.

2. Peel an orange and remove as much of the white portion as possible.
Remove pulp by sections, which may be accomplished by using a sharp
knife and cutting pulp from tough portion first on one side of section,
then on the other. Should there be any white portion of skin remaining
on pulp it should be cut off. Arrange sections on glass dish or fruit
plate. If the orange is a seeded one, remove seeds.

3. Remove peel from an orange in such a way that there remains a
one-half inch band of peel equal distance from stem and blossom end. Cut
band, separate sections, and arrange around a mould of sugar.

sugar and spice. Allow one-half cup sugar and one-fourth teaspoon
cinnamon or nutmeg to eight apples. If nutmeg is used, a few drops lemon
juice and few gratings from rind of lemon to each apple is an
improvement. Cover bottom of dish with boiling water, and bake in a hot
oven until soft, basting often with syrup in dish. Serve hot or cold
with cream. Many prefer to pare apples before baking. When this is done,
core before paring, that fruit may keep in shape. In the fall, when
apples are at their best, do not add spices to apples, as their flavor
cannot be improved; but towards spring they become somewhat tasteless,
and spice is an improvement.

little additional water is needed. Cook until soft. If rhubarb is
covered with boiling water, allowed to stand five minutes, then drained
and cooked, less sugar will be required. Rhubarb is sometimes baked in
an earthen pudding-dish. If baked slowly for a long time it has a rich
red color.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\section*{Jellies}

Jellies are made of cooked fruit juice and sugar, in nearly all cases
the proportions being equal. Where failures occur, they may usually be
traced to the use of too ripe fruit.

\textbf{To Prepare Glasses for Jelly.} Wash glasses and put in a kettle of cold
water; place on range, and heat water gradually to boiling-point. Remove
glasses, and drain. Place glasses while filling on a cloth wrung out of
hot water.

\textbf{To Cover Jelly Glasses.} Cut letter paper in circular pieces just to
fit in top of glasses. Dip in brandy, and cover jelly. Put on tin covers
or circular pieces of paper cut larger than the glasses, and fastened
securely over the edge with mucilage. Some prefer to cover jelly with
melted paraffine then to adjust covers.

\textbf{To Make a Jelly Bag.} Fold two opposite corners of a piece of cotton
and wool flannel three-fourths yard long. Sew up in the form of a
cornucopia, rounding at the end. Fell the seam to make more secure. Bind
the top with tape, and furnish with two or three heavy loops by which it
may be hung.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Apple Jelly}

Wipe apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and cut in quarters. Put in a
granite or porcelain-lined preserving kettle, and add cold water to come
nearly to top of apples. Cover, and cook slowly until apples are soft;
mash, and drain through a coarse sieve. Avoid squeezing apples, which
makes jelly cloudy. Then allow juice to drip through a double thickness
of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Boil twenty minutes, and add an equal
quantity of heated sugar; boil five minutes, skim, and turn in glasses.
Put in a sunny window, and let stand twenty-four hours. Cover, and keep
in a cool, dry place. Porter apples make a delicious flavored jelly. If
apples are pared, a much lighter jelly may be made. Gravenstein apples
make a very spicy jelly.

\textbf{To Heat Sugar.} Put in a granite dish, place in oven, leaving oven door
ajar, and stir occasionally.

white currants are considered desirable, and make a lighter colored
jelly.

Pick over currants, but do not remove stems; wash and drain. Mash a few
in the bottom of a preserving kettle, using a wooden potato masher; so
continue until berries are used. Cook slowly until currants look white.
Strain through a course strainer, then allow juice to drop through a
double thickness of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Measure, bring to
boiling-point, and boil five minutes; add unequal measure of heated
sugar, boil three minutes, skim, and pour into glasses. Place in a sunny
window, and let stand twenty-four hours. Cover, and keep in a cool, dry
place.

\section*{Canning And Preserving}

Preserving fruit is cooking it with from three-fourths to its whole
weight of sugar. By so doing, much of the natural flavor of the fruit is
destroyed; therefore canning is usually preferred to preserving.

Canning fruit is preserving sterilized fruit in sterilized air-tight
jars, the sugar being added to give sweetness. Fruits may be canned
without sugar if perfectly sterilized, that is, freed from all germ
life.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Directions for Canning}

Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good quality, and not
over-ripe; if over-ripe, some of the spores may survive the boiling,
then fermentation will take place in a short time.

For canning fruit, allow one-third its weight in sugar, and two and
one-half to three cups water to each pound of sugar. Boil sugar and
water ten minutes to make a thin syrup; then cook a small quantity of
the fruit at a time in the syrup; by so doing, fruit may be kept in
perfect shape. Hard fruits, like pineapple and quince, are cooked in
boiling water until nearly soft, then put in syrup to finish cooking.
Sterilized jars are then filled with fruit, and enough syrup added to
overflow jars. If there is not sufficient syrup, add boiling water, as
jars must be filled to overflow. Introduce a spoon between fruit and
jar, that air bubbles may rise to the top and break; then quickly put on
rubbers and screw on sterilized covers. Let stand until cold, again
screw covers, being sure this time that jars are air-tight. While
filling jars, place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{To Sterilize Jars}

Wash jars and fill with cold water. Set in a kettle on a trivet, and
surround with cold water. Heat gradually to boiling-point, remove from
water, empty, and fill while hot. Put covers in hot water and let stand
five minutes. Dip rubber bands in hot water, but do not allow them to
stand. New rubbers should be used each season, and care must be taken
that rims of covers are not bent, as jars cannot then be hermetically
sealed.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Canned Porter Apples}

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare Porter apples, then weigh. Make a syrup by
boiling for ten minutes one-third their weight in sugar with water,
allowing two and one-half cups to each pound of sugar. Cook apples in
syrup until soft, doing a few at a time. Fill jars, following Directions
for Canning.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Canned Peaches}

Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing them to stand just long
enough to easily loosen skins. Remove skins and cook fruit at once, that
it may not discolor, following Directions for Canning. Some prefer to
pare peaches, sprinkle with sugar, and let stand over night. In morning
drain, add water to fruit syrup, bring to boiling-point, and then cook
fruit. Peaches may be cut in halves, or smaller pieces if desired.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Canned Pears}

Wipe and pare fruit. Cook whole with stems left on, or remove stems, cut
in quarters, and core. Follow Directions for Canning. A small piece of
ginger root or a few slicings of lemon rind may be cooked with syrup.
Bartlett pears are the best for canning.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Canned Pineapples}

Remove skin and eyes from pineapples; then cut in half-inch slices, and
slices in cubes, at the same time discarding the core. Follow Directions
for Canning. Pineapples may be shredded and cooked in one-half their
weight of sugar without water, and then put in jars. When put up in this
way they are useful for the making of sherbets and fancy desserts.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Canned Quinces}

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare quinces. Follow Directions for Canning.

\subsection*{Damson Preserves}

Wipe damsons with a piece of cheese-cloth wrung out of cold water, and
prick each fruit five or six times, using a large needle; then weigh.
Make a syrup by boiling three-fourths their weight in sugar with water,
allowing one cup to each pound of sugar. As soon as syrup reaches
boiling-point, skim, and add plums, a few at a time, that fruit may
better keep in shape during cooking. Cook until soft. It is well to use
two kettles, that work may be more quickly done, and syrup need not cook
too long a time. Put into glass or stone jars.



\needspace{15\baselineskip}
\subsection*{Strawberry Preserves}

Pick over, wash, drain, and hull strawberries; then weigh. Fill glass
jars with berries. Make a syrup same as for Damson Preserve, cooking the
syrup fifteen minutes. Add syrup to overflow jars; let stand fifteen
minutes, when fruit will have shrunk, and more fruit must be added to
fill jars. Screw on covers, put on a trivet in a kettle of cold water,
heat water to boiling-point, and keep just below boiling-point one hour.

Raspberries may be preserved in the same way.

\chapter{Helpful Hints}



\textbf{To Scald Milk.} Put in top of double boiler, having water boiling in
under part. Cover, and let stand on top of range until milk around edge
of double boiler has a bead-like appearance.


\textbf{For Buttered Cracker Crumbs}, allow from one-fourth to one-third cup
melted butter to each cup of crumbs. Stir lightly with a fork in mixing,
that crumbs may be evenly coated and light rather than compact.


\textbf{To Cream Butter.} Put in a bowl and work with a wooden spoon until soft
and of creamy consistency. Should buttermilk exude from butter it should
be poured off.


\textbf{To Extract Juice from Onion.} Cut a slice from root end of onion, draw
back the skin, and press onion on a coarse grater, working with a rotary
motion.


\textbf{To Chop Parsley.} Remove leaves from parsley. If parsley is wet, first
dry in a towel. Gather parsley between thumb and fingers and press
compactly. With a sharp vegetable knife cut through and through. Again
gather in fingers and recut, so continuing until parsley is finely cut.


\textbf{To Caramelize Sugar.} Put in a smooth granite saucepan or omelet pan,
place over hot part of range, and stir constantly until melted and of
the color of maple syrup. Care must be taken to prevent sugar from
adhering to sides of pan or spoon.


\textbf{To Make Caramel.} Continue the caramelization of sugar until syrup is
quite brown and a whitish smoke arises from it. Add an equal quantity of
boiling water, and simmer until of the consistency of a thick syrup. Of
use in coloring soups, sauces, etc.


\textbf{Acidulated Water} is water to which vinegar or lemon juice is added.
One tablespoon of the acid is allowed to one quart water.


\textbf{To Blanch Almonds.} Cover Jordan almonds with boiling water and let
stand two minutes; drain, put into cold water, and rub off the skins.
Dry between towels.


\textbf{To Shred Almonds.} Cut blanched almonds in thin strips lengthwise of
the nut.


\textbf{Macaroon Dust.} Dry macaroons pounded and sifted.


\textbf{To Shell Chestnuts.} Cut a half-inch gash on flat sides and put in an
omelet pan, allowing one-half teaspoon butter to each cup chestnuts.
Shake over range until butter is melted. Put in oven and let stand five
minutes. Remove from oven, and with a small knife take off shells. By
this method shelling and blanching is accomplished at the same time, as
skins adhere to shells.


\textbf{Flavoring Extracts and Wine} should be added if possible to a mixture
when cold. If added while mixture is hot, much of the goodness passes
off with the steam.


\textbf{Meat Glaze.} Four quarts stock reduced to one cup.


\textbf{Mixed Mustard.} Mix two tablespoons mustard and one teaspoon sugar, add
hot water gradually until of the consistency of a thick paste. Vinegar
may be used in place of water.


\textbf{To Prevent Salt from Lumping.} Mix with corn-starch, allowing one
teaspoon corn-starch to six teaspoons salt.


\textbf{To Wash Carafes.} Half fill with hot soapsuds, to which is added one
teaspoon washing soda. Put in newspaper torn in small pieces. Let stand
one-half hour, occasionally shaking. Empty, rinse with hot water, drain,
wipe outside, and let stand to dry inside.


\textbf{After Broiling or Frying}, if any fat has spattered on range, wipe
surface at once with newspaper.


\textbf{To Remove Fruit Stains.} Pour boiling water over stained surface,
having it fall from a distance of three feet. This is a much better way
than dipping stain in and out of hot water; or wring articles out of
cold water and hang out of doors on a frosty night.


\textbf{To Remove Stains of Claret Wine.} As soon as claret is spilt, cover
spot with salt. Let stand a few minutes, then rinse in cold water.


\textbf{To Clean Graniteware} where mixtures have been cooked or burned on.
Half fill with cold water, add washing soda, heat water gradually to
boiling-point, then empty, when dish may be easily washed. Pearline or
any soap-powder may be used in place of washing soda.


\textbf{To Wash Mirrors and Windows.} Rub over with chamois skin wrung out of
warm water, then wipe with a piece of dry chamois skin. This method
saves much strength.


\textbf{To Remove White Spots from Furniture.} Dip a cloth in hot water nearly
to boiling-point. Place over spot, remove quickly, and rub over spot
with a dry cloth. Repeat if spot is not removed. Alcohol or camphor
quickly applied may be used.


\textbf{Tumblers} which have contained milk should be first rinsed in cold
water before washing in hot water.


To keep a \textbf{Sink Drain} free from grease, pour down once a week at night
one-half can Babbitt's potash dissolved in one quart water.


Should \textbf{Sink Drain} chance to get choked, pour into sink one-fourth
pound copperas dissolved in two quarts boiling water. If this is not
efficacious, repeat before sending for a plumber.


Never put \textbf{Knives} with ivory handles in water. Hot water causes them to
crack and discolor.


To prevent \textbf{Glassware} from being easily broken, put in a kettle of cold
water, heat gradually until water has reached boiling-point. Set aside;
when water is cold take out glass. This is a most desirable way to
toughen lamp chimneys.


\textbf{To Remove Grease Spots.} Cold water and Ivory Soap will remove grease
spots from cotton and woollen fabrics. Castilian Cream is useful for
black woollen goods, but leaves a light ring on delicately colored
goods. Ether is always sure and safe to use.


\textbf{To Remove Iron Rust.} Saturate spot with lemon juice, then cover with
salt. Let stand in the sun for several hours; or a solution of
hydrochloric acid may be used.


\textbf{Iron Rust} may be removed from delicate fabrics by covering spot
thickly with cream of tartar, then twisting cloth to keep cream of
tartar over spot; put in a saucepan of cold water, and heat water
gradually to boiling-point.


\textbf{To Remove Grass Stains} from cotton goods, wash in alcohol.


\textbf{To Remove Ink Stains.} Wash in a solution of hydrochloric acid, and
rinse in ammonia water. Wet the spot with warm water, put on Sapolio,
rub gently between the hands, and generally the spot will disappear.


\textbf{Cut Glass} should be washed and rinsed in water that is not very hot
and of same temperature.


In \textbf{Sweeping Carpets}, keep broom close to floor and work with the grain
of the carpet. Occasionally turn broom that it may wear evenly.


\textbf{Tie Strands of a New Broom} closely together, put into a pail of
boiling water, and soak two hours. Dry thoroughly before using.


Never wash the inside of \textbf{Tea or Coffee Pots} with soapsuds. If granite
or agate ware is used, and becomes badly discolored, nearly fill pot
with Cold water, add one tablespoon borax, and heat gradually until
water reaches the boiling-point. Rinse with hot water, wipe, and keep on
back of range until perfectly dry.


Never put cogs of a \textbf{Dover Egg-beater} in water.


Never wash \textbf{Bread Boards} in a sink. Scrub with grain of wood, using a
small brush.


Before using a new \textbf{Iron Kettle}, grease inside and outside, and let
stand forty-eight hours; then wash in hot water in which a large lump of
cooking soda has been dissolved.


To clean a \textbf{Copper Boiler}, use Putz Pomade Cream. Apply with a woollen
cloth when boiler is warm, not hot; then rub off with second woollen
cloth and polish with flannel or chamois. If badly tarnished, use oxalic
acid. Faucets and brasses are treated in the same way.


A bottle containing \textbf{Oxalic Acid} should be marked poison, and kept on a
high shelf.


To keep an \textbf{Ice Chest} in good condition, wash thoroughly once a week
with cold or lukewarm water in which washing soda has been dissolved. If
by chance anything is spilt in an ice chest, it should be wiped off at
once.

Milk and butter very quickly absorb odors, and if in ice chest with
other foods, should be kept closely covered.


\textbf{Hard Wood Floors and Furniture} may be polished by using a small
quantity of kerosene oil applied with a woollen cloth, then rubbing with
a clean woollen cloth. A very good furniture polish is made by using
equal parts linseed oil and turpentine.


\textbf{Polish for Hard Wood Floors.} Use one part beeswax to two parts
turpentine. Put in saucepan on range, and when wax is dissolved a paste
will be formed.


To clean \textbf{Piano Keys}, rub over with alcohol.


To remove old \textbf{Tea and Coffee Stains}, wet spot with cold water, cover
with glycerine, and let stand two or three hours. Then wash with cold
water and hard soap. Repeat if necessary.


Before \textbf{Sweeping Old Carpets}, sprinkle with pieces of newspaper wrung
out of water. After sweeping, wipe over with a cloth wrung out of a weak
solution of ammonia water, which seems to brighten colors.


Platt's Chloride is one of the best \textbf{Disinfectants}. Chloride of lime is
a valuable disinfectant, and much cheaper than Platt's Chloride.


\textbf{Listerine} is an excellent disinfectant to use for the mouth and
throat.


\textbf{To Make a Pastry Bag.} Fold a twelve-inch square of rubber cloth from
two opposite corners. Sew edges together, forming a triangular bag. Cut
off point to make opening large enough to insert a tin pastry tube. A
set comprising bag and twelve adjustable tubes may be bought for two and
one-half dollars.


\textbf{Smoked Ceilings} may be cleaned by washing with cloths wrung out of
water in which a small piece of washing soda has been dissolved.


\textbf{For a Burn} apply equal parts of white of egg and olive oil mixed
together, then cover with a piece of old linen; if applied at once no
blister will form. Or apply at once cooking soda, then cover with cloth
and keep the same wet with cold water. This takes out the pain and
prevents blistering.


\textbf{Curtain and Portière Poles} allow the hangings to slip easily if rubbed
with hard soap. This is much better than greasing.


\textbf{Creaking Doors and Drawers} should be treated in the same way.


\textbf{To Remove Dust from Rattan Furniture} use a painter's small brush.
